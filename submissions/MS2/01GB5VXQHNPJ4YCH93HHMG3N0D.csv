23,25263079,"In the early 1970s all colorectal cancer patients with metastases received intravenous 5-fl uorouracil ( 5FU ) chemotherapy which often continued despite tumor progression . Some patients also received chemotherapy after radical resection as it was thought that the treatment at least could slow down the progress of the cancer . This practice was terminated at our hospital in 1976 , supported by the paper of Moertel who question ed the role of 5FU , stating that it was a nontreatment and also emphasized its side effects [ 1 ] . Despite his skepticism , Moertel continued his search for combinations which could infl uence the course of colorectal cancers . In 1989 and 1990 , two seminal papers reported that 5FU combined with the antihelmintic drug levamisol for one year improved disease-free survival ( DFS ) and cancer-specifi c survival ( CSS ) [ 2,3 ] . After the National Institute of Health Consensus Statement , this regimen rapidly was accepted in USA and most countries worldwide [ 4 ] . However , in the Sc and inavian countries the new treatment was met with initial skepticism by the surgeons who had learned that 5FU had limited success in colorectal cancer . In the current issue of Acta Oncologica , B ö ckelman et al. present an up date d review on the prognosis for colon cancer stage II and III [ 8 ] . The review is one in a series of papers from an Acta Oncologica initiative to promote young scientists in the Nordic countries , ‘ young scientist ’ s workshop ’ held during the Acta Oncologica 50 year celebration in 2013 [ 9,10 ] . This is important information refl ecting the current status of treatment of colon cancer , in contrast to a continuous improvement in treatment of rectal cancer including more extensive surgery termed total mesorectal excision , staging with MRI , multidisciplinary team and use of preoperative radiochemotherapy [ 12 – 14 ] . Recently a similar focus on careful systematic surgery for colon cancer with central lymph node dissection ( D3 resection ) and total mesocolic excision has been accepted and is introduced in clinical practice [ 15 – 18 ] . Colon cancer surgery is becoming more limited to gastrointestinal surgeons specially trained in colorectal surgery [ 19 ] . Also the pathology assessment of the operation specimens has improved [ 20,21 ] ."

41,22419291,"BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the Western world . Apart from surgery - which remains the mainstay of treatment for resectable primary tumours - postoperative ( i.e. , adjuvant ) chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) based regimens is now the st and ard treatment in Dukes ' C ( TNM stage III ) colon tumours i.e. tumours with metastases in the regional lymph nodes but no distant metastases . In contrast , the evidence for recommendations of adjuvant therapy in rectal cancer is sparse . In Europe it is generally acknowledged that locally advanced rectal tumours receive preoperative ( i.e. , neoadjuvant ) downstaging by radiotherapy ( or chemoradiotion ) , whereas in the US postoperative chemoradiotion is considered the treatment of choice in all Dukes ' C rectal cancers .

112,19841457,"Context Ventilation strategies to protect the lungs of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) include low tidal volume , limited airway pressures , and medium to high positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) , but the adoption of these strategies has been slow in some clinical setting s. Contribution This review of r and omized trial evidence for low tidal volume and high PEEP ventilation on mortality of patients with ARDS or acute lung injury found that trials were limited in number but showed mortality benefits with lower versus higher tidal volume . The Editors The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is clinical ly characterized by sudden onset , severe hypoxemia , radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltration , and absence of left heart failure ( 13 ) . Acute lung injury is a subset of ARDS with less severe impairment in oxygenation . Despite apparent improvement in management and outcome of ARDS , the mortality rate in persons with the disease remains high , ranging from 35 % to 65 % ( 4 ) . Although mechanical ventilation provides essential life support , it can worsen lung injury ( 5 ) . Ventilator-induced lung injury is caused by excessive stress or strain to lung tissues that occurs during mechanical ventilation and aggravates inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage ( 5 , 13 ) . Lung-protective ventilation strategies include ventilation with low Vt and limited airway pressure to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury from overdistention while allowing hypercapnia and medium to high positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) to keep alveoli open throughout the ventilator cycle ( 14 ) . Hypercapnia and acidosis may increase intracranial pressure , induce pulmonary hypertension , depress myocardial contractility , decrease renal blood flow , and release endogenous catecholamines ( 15 ) . In addition , prevention of cyclic derecruitment with higher PEEP may contribute to overdistention of normally aerated alveoli , counterbalancing the benefits from low Vt and limited airway pressure ventilation cycles ( 14 ) . This may explain why most critically ill patients are still ventilated with high Vt at lower or even no PEEP ( 4 , 25 ) . Our objective was to determine whether the different lung-protective ventilatory strategies improve outcome in critically ill adults with acute lung injury or ARDS . Methods Data Sources and Search es We aim ed to identify all RCTs assessing the efficacy and outcomes of lower Vt ventilation , higher PEEP application , or a combination of both in adults with acute lung injury or ARDS ."

Although often not immediately life-threatening , they place substantial burdens on the health , economic status , and quality of life of individuals , families , and communities ( 1 ) . Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 10 % of persons 65 years of age and older and increases the risk for other chronic conditions , including ischemic heart disease , renal disease , and visual impairment ( 2 ) . Despite this enthusiasm , experts do not agree on the definition of what constitutes a chronic disease self-management program , which elements of self-management programs are essential regardless of the clinical condition , or which elements are important for specific conditions . Several recent review s on chronic disease self-management interventions have been published , including 2 Cochrane collaborations ( 6 - 13 ) . Almost all have been disease-specific . Almost all previous review s have been disease-specific or addressed specific intervention components within specific disease conditions ( 14 - 17 ) . In our review , we sought to quantitatively assess chronic disease self-management programs for older adults within and across disease conditions .

179,27820156,"REVIEW OBJECTIVE The objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesis e the best available evidence to examine whether periodontal disease is a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis . BACKGROUND Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology and has a complex multifactorial pathogenesis affecting joints and other tissues . The natural history of rheumatoid arthritis is poorly defined ; its clinical course fluctuates and the prognosis unpredictable . Rheumatoid arthritis affects up to 1 - 3 % of the population , with a 3:1 female preponderance disappearing in older age . There is also evidence of a genetic predisposition to the disease . Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by progressive and irreversible damage of the synovial-lined joints causing loss of joint space , bone and function , leading to deformity . Extracellular matrix degradation is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis which is responsible for the typical destruction of cartilage , ligaments , tendons , and bone . Rheumatoid arthritis is characteristically a symmetric arthritis ( symmetrical swelling of the joints ) . Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation , with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints . Extra-articular signs can involve pulmonary , cardiovascular , nervous , and reticuloendothelial systems . The clinical presentation of rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis varies , but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of the small joints is the most frequent finding . Rheumatoid arthritis onset is acute or subacute in about 25 % of patients . Early rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by symmetric polyarthritis involving the small joints of the h and s and feet with no radiologic changes . Rheumatoid arthritis most frequently affects the metacarpophalangeal , proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints . Although any joint , including the cricoarytenoid joint , can be affected , the distal interphalangeal , the sacroiliac and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved , which is peculiar because these are some of the most typical targets of seronegative spondylarthropathies , such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis . The clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis vary , depending on the involved joints and the disease stage . The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning . Morning stiffness in and around the joints , lasting at least 1 hour before maximal improvement is a typical sign of rheumatoid arthritis . It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness . Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity . Progression of rheumatoid arthritis can be measured by laboratory tests and clinical evaluation ( question naires of disease activity and physical examination ) . Laboratory tests include blood tests for Rheumatoid factor ( RF ) and Acute-phase reaction tests while clinical evaluation can be measured by the Disease activity using the Disease Activity Score ( DAS ) . Periodontitis is a destructive inflammatory disease of the dental supporting tissues which leads to erosion of bone around teeth result ing in tooth loss . Severe periodontitis affects about 5 - 15 % of the adult population . In periodontitis , the clinical findings of bone resorption and loss of clinical attachment level around tooth are a result of inflammatory mediated alterations to the bone remodelling balance . The inflammatory infiltrate present between the plaque biofilm , bone and connective tissues regulate the host immune response to the bacteria . The host produces proteases and substances that de grade the extracellular matrix , and lead to resorption of the alveolar bone , result ing in irreversible loss of tissue attachment . Bone is a dynamic tissue and bone homeostasis involves the opposing events of resorption and apposition ; dissolution of the existing bone mineral , resorption of the extracellular matrix , and formation of a new matrix . Bone homeostasis mechanisms maintain bone integrity in the alveolar bone ( regulates periodontal bone loss ) and , elsewhere in the body . It also functions to regulate the calcium balance within the body ; this is an important ion as it is involved in the clotting of blood , formation of gl and ular secretions and regulation of the cardiac pacemaker . Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis are arguably the most prevalent chronic inflammatory diseases in humans and associated with significant morbidities . Both rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis present an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines , which is thought to be responsible for the tissue damage . In this sense , both conditions are associated with destruction of bone , mediated by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 , tumour necrosis factor and prostagl and in E2.Several studies have suggested a relationship between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis ; rheumatoid arthritis may have a negative impact on periodontal condition and vice versa . Mercado et al. in 2001 reported a significantly high prevalence of moderate to severe periodontitis in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis . In addition , the converse is true : periodontitis patients have a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis compared to the general population . One hypothesis that links rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis is the recently published " two-hit " model that attempts to link experimental evidence from animal models and is supported by evidence from human clinical studies . In this theory , the first " hit " involves the periodontopathic subgingival biofilm and its microbial products , such as endotoxin . The second " hit " involves a medical systemic disease , such as rheumatoid arthritis , which increases biomarkers of systemic inflammation in the circulation , including C reactive protein ( CRP ) , cytokines ( e.g. IL-6 ) , prostanoids ( e.g. PGE2 ) , and matrix metalloproteinases ( e.g. MMP-9 ) , and tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF- α ) . These cytokines are thought to stimulate resident cells in the synovium and the periodontium to produce MMPs mediating connective tissue destruction , and induce the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts to destroy bone In particular , TNF-α , also promotes bone resorption : ( i ) by up-regulating inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) and the production of nitric oxide ( NO ) ; and ( ii ) by modulating the receptor activator of nuclear factor _ B ( NF_B ) lig and ( RANKL ) in osteoblasts , and its antagonist osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) , thus altering the RANKL/OPG ratio , which enhances osteoclast activity , and finally , lead to periodontal breakdown . Aggressive periodontitis is rapid progression of periodontal disease with severe periodontal breakdown . As no systematic review has been identified as been either published or underway on this topic , the aim of this systematic review is to identify and synthesis e the best available evidence of periodontal disease as a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis"

708,12065068,"BACKGROUND The incidence of lung cancer is declining following a drop in smoking rates , but it is still the leading cause of death from cancer in Engl and and Wales , with about 30,000 deaths a year . Survival rates for lung cancer are poor everywhere , but they appear to be better in the rest of the European Community and the USA than in the UK . Only about 5 per cent of people with lung cancer survive for 5 years , and nearly all of these are cured by surgery after fortuitously early diagnosis . At present , only a small proportion of patients ( probably about 5 per cent ) with non-small-cell lung cancer are being given chemotherapy . Some centres treat a greater proportion . OBJECTIVES This review examines the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of four of the newer drugs - vinorelbine , gemcitabine , paclitaxel and docetaxel - used for treating the most common type of lung cancer ( non-small-cell lung cancer ) . The first three drugs are used for first-line treatment , but at present docetaxel is used only after first-line chemotherapy has failed . RESULTS - COSTS : The total cost to the NHS of using these new drugs in Engl and and Wales might be about GBP 10 million per annum , but is subject to a number of factors . CONCLUSIONS - IMPLICATION S OF THE NEWER DRUGS : One of the present constraints on chemotherapy is availability of inpatient beds . The advent of newer and gentler forms of chemotherapy given on an outpatient basis would not only overcome this , but it would allow more patients to be treated . This might apply particularly to older patients . The treatment of more patients would increase workload for oncologists , cancer nurses and pharmacists ."

712,28971436,"INTRODUCTION Worldwide , breast cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death ( after lung , stomach , liver and colon cancer ) , while among women it is first on the list . The incidence of breast cancer has made a dramatic increase since 1970 which is partly interpreted by the modern western life st and ards . The expected risk of breast cancer throughout a lifespan of an average is 1 in 11 women . The five-year survival rates for breast cancer are at 80 % if it has not spread , and only at 40 % for the metastatic type of cancer . The concept of survival comes from the US , where there is an active promotion of self-help difficulties coping strategies . Surviving from cancer may be a mixed experience . Survivors of cancer often say they are still running a full and meaningful life after experiencing a threatening disease . Others may find it difficult to h and le the feeling that they have no right to be alive , which is probably related to the guilt of survival after the war . Although the survival potential for some is a satisfactory fee , others may be looking for improvement , change , or to adapt their life and struggle with the late effects of cancer after stopping the treatment . In recent years it has been observed that survival of women with breast cancer has increased significantly because of current antineoplastic therapeutic interventions . The definition of support needs derives from the one of supportive care considering that there is no theoretical framework or specific definition at the moment . " It includes the period before the final diagnosis , during the diagnosis and the treatments or during the ongoing disease with recurrences and the survivors of the disease . " PURPOSE The purpose of this review is to describe the tools used in research to measure and evaluate supportive care needs during long-term survival of women with breast cancer ."

731,31858595,"BACKGROUND Poliomyelitis is a debilitating and deadly infection . Despite exponential growth in medical science , there is still no cure for the disease , which is caused by three types of wild polioviruses : types 1 , 2 , and 3 . According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) , wild poliovirus is still in circulation in three countries , and fresh cases have been reported even in the year 2018 . Due to the administration of live vaccines , the risk for vaccine-derived poliovirus ( VDPV ) is high in areas that are free from wild polioviruses . This is evident based on the fact that VDPV caused 20 outbreaks between 2000 and 2011 . Recent recommendations from the World Health Organization favoured the inclusion of inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) in the global immunisation schedule . IPV can be delivered in two ways : intramuscularly and intradermally . IPV was previously administered intramuscularly , but shortages in vaccine supplies , coupled with the higher costs of the vaccines , led to the innovation of delivering a fractional dose ( one-fifth ) of IPV intradermally . However , there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy , immunogenicity , and safety of an intradermal , fractional dose of IPV compared to an intramuscular , full dose of IPV . OBJECTIVES To compare the immunogenicity and efficacy of an inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) in equivalent immunisation schedules using fractional-dose IPV given via the intradermal route versus full-dose IPV given via the intramuscular route ."

820,15674937,"BACKGROUND Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is characterized by a life-long chronic course with remissions and exacerbations . Approximately 15 % of patients have a severe attack requiring hospitalization at some time during their illness . These patients are traditionally treated with intravenous corticosteroids , with a response rate of approximately 60 % . The patients who do not respond to steroid treatment usually require surgical removal of the large bowel ( proctocolectomy or colectomy with an anal pouch ) . This surgical procedure essentially cures the patient from the disease but is associated with complications such as pouchitis . Few alternative treatments exist for severe ulcerative colitis : immunosuppressive medications ( such as azathioprine ) have a slow onset of action and are therefore usually ineffective . Antibiotics are not proven to be effective and biological treatments such as infliximab are still under investigation . The introduction of cyclosporine-A ( CsA ) for use in patients with severe ulcerative colitis ( UC ) has provided an alternative to patients previously facing only surgical options . Cyclosporine acts mainly by inhibiting T lymphocyte function , which is essential for the propagation of inflammation . Unlike most other immunosuppressive agents , CsA does not suppress the activity of other hematopoietic cells , does not cause bone marrow suppression and has a rapid onset of action . This review s aims to systematic ally assess the effectiveness and safety of CsA for severe UC .

860,31523806,"BACKGROUND The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include pre-eclampsia , gestational hypertension , chronic hypertension , and undefined hypertension . Pre-eclampsia is considerably more prevalent in low-income than in high-income countries . One possible explanation for this discrepancy is dietary differences , particularly calcium deficiency . Calcium supplementation in the second half of pregnancy reduces the serious consequences of pre-eclampsia , but has limited effect on the overall risk of pre-eclampsia . It is important to establish whether calcium supplementation before , and in early pregnancy ( before 20 weeks ' gestation ) has added benefit . Such evidence could count towards justification of population -level interventions to improve dietary calcium intake , including fortification of staple foods with calcium , especially in context s where dietary calcium intake is known to be inadequate . This is an up date of a review first published in 2017 .

In an era of increasing complexity of immunization schedules , rising expectations about the performance of primary care , and large dem and s on primary care providers , it is important to underst and and promote interventions that work in primary care setting s to increase immunization coverage . One common theme across immunization programs in many nations involves the challenge of implementing a population -based approach and identifying all eligible recipients , for example the children who should receive the measles vaccine . However , this issue is gradually being addressed through the availability of immunization registries and electronic health records . A second common theme is identifying the best strategies to promote high vaccination rates . Three types of strategies have been studied : ( 1 ) patient-oriented interventions , such as patient reminder or recall , ( 2 ) provider interventions , and ( 3 ) system interventions , such as school laws .

1396,24865303,"BACKGROUND Mechanical ventilation is important in caring for patients with critical illness . Clinical complications , increased mortality , and high costs of health care are associated with prolonged ventilatory support or premature discontinuation of mechanical ventilation . Weaning refers to the process of gradually or abruptly withdrawing mechanical ventilation . The weaning process begins after partial or complete resolution of the underlying pathophysiology precipitating respiratory failure and ends with weaning success ( successful extubation in intubated patients or permanent withdrawal of ventilatory support in tracheostomized patients ) . OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two strategies , a T-tube and pressure support ventilation , for weaning adult patients with respiratory failure that required invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours , measuring weaning success and other clinical ly important outcomes ."
1397,16454604,"In these tumors , mortality data do not reflect the true incidence of this disease , since survival has improved in recent years , particularly in younger individuals . In contrast to other European countries , Spain ranks in an intermediate position in terms of CRC-related incidence and mortality . This risk clearly increases with age , with a notorious rise in incidence from 50 years of age on . Survival following CRC detection and management greatly depends upon tumor stage at the time of diagnosis ; hence the importance of early detection and –because of their malignant potential– of the recognition and excision of colorectal adenomas . Thus , polypectomy and then surveillance are the primary cornerstones in the prevention of CRC ( 1 - 4 ) . For primary prevention , fiber-rich diets , physical exercising , and the avoidance of overweight , smoking , and alcohol have been recommended . Low-dose NSAIDs or ASA are still not recommended for the prevention of CRC as of today ( 1 ) . CRC develops through well-established stages from lesions in colonic gl and crypts to adenomas to cancer . The adenoma-carcinoma sequence is characterized by cumulative mutations in both suppressor genes and oncogenes , which affect the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis ; thus , each mutational event confers tumor cells with a growth advantage entailing a clonal expansion along multiple stages , and ultimately tumor progression ( 5 ) . From all the above , CRC screening is warranted : a ) this tumor has a high incidence and results in severe morbidity and mortality ; b ) the premalignant potential of colorectal adenomas is well known ; c ) the tumor may be detected using highly sensitive endoscopic techniques ; and d ) early management improves survival . The population with a moderate risk for CRC includes individuals older than 50 years with no additional risk factors ( family members with CRC or adenomas , chronic inflammatory bowel disease ) . The most cost-effective screening option for each population area or country remains to be established , as well as as its financial impact on healthcare systems ( 7 - 9 ) ."
1398,26537796,"BACKGROUND Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is highly debilitating , difficult to treat , has a high rate of recurrence , and negatively impacts the individual and society as a whole . One emerging potential treatment for MDD is n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-3PUFAs ) , also known as omega-3 oils , naturally found in fatty fish , some other seafood , and some nuts and seeds . Various lines of evidence suggest a role for n-3PUFAs in MDD , but the evidence is far from conclusive . Investigations of heterogeneity suggest differential effects of n-3PUFAs , depending on severity of depressive symptoms , where no effects of n-3PUFAs are found in studies of individuals with mild depressive symptomology , but possible benefit may be suggested in studies of individuals with more severe depressive symptomology .

1413,27176676,"BACKGROUND Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide . People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms ; these episodes are often known as ' exacerbations ' , ' flare-ups ' , ' attacks ' or ' acute asthma ' . Oral steroids , which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect , are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations ; they should be initiated promptly . The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone , but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries , and often among different guideline producers within the same country .

1646,30699468,"BACKGROUND Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is insufficient to meet physiologic needs ; it is caused by many conditions , particularly iron deficiency . Traditionally , daily iron supplementation has been a st and ard practice for preventing and treating anaemia . However , its long-term use has been limited , as it has been associated with adverse side effects such as nausea , constipation , and teeth staining . Intermittent iron supplementation has been suggested as an effective and safer alternative to daily iron supplementation for preventing and reducing anaemia at the population level , especially in areas where this condition is highly prevalent . OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of intermittent oral iron supplementation , alone or in combination with other nutrients , on anaemia and its associated impairments among menstruating women , compared with no intervention , a placebo , or daily supplementation ."

1649,27569680,"BACKGROUND Bronchodilators are a central component for treating exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) all over the world . Clinicians often use nebulisers as a mode of delivery , especially in the acute setting , and many patients seem to benefit from them . However , evidence supporting this choice from systematic analysis is sparse , and available data are frequently biased by the inclusion of asthma patients . Therefore , there is little or no formal guidance regarding the mode of delivery , which has led to a wide variation in practice between and within countries and even among doctors in the same hospital . We assessed the available r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) to help guide practice in a more uniform way . OBJECTIVES To compare the effects of nebulisers versus pressurised metered dose inhalers ( pMDI ) plus spacer or dry powder inhalers ( DPI ) in bronchodilator therapy for exacerbations of COPD ."

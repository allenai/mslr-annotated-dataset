Some patients also received chemotherapy after radical resection as it was thought that the treatment at least could slow down the progress of the cancer .
This practice was terminated at our hospital in 1976 , supported by the paper of Moertel who question ed the role of 5FU , stating that it was a nontreatment and also emphasized its side effects [ 1 ] .
Despite his skepticism , Moertel continued his search for combinations which could infl uence the course of colorectal cancers .

112,19841457,High PEEP did not improve mortality in unselected patients but may help patients with life-threatening hypoxemia despite other interventions .,"Context Ventilation strategies to protect the lungs of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) include low tidal volume , limited airway pressures , and medium to high positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) , but the adoption of these strategies has been slow in some clinical setting s. Contribution This review of r and omized trial evidence for low tidal volume and high PEEP ventilation on mortality of patients with ARDS or acute lung injury found that trials were limited in number but showed mortality benefits with lower versus higher tidal volume .
The Editors The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is clinical ly characterized by sudden onset , severe hypoxemia , radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltration , and absence of left heart failure ( 13 ) .
Acute lung injury is a subset of ARDS with less severe impairment in oxygenation .
Despite apparent improvement in management and outcome of ARDS , the mortality rate in persons with the disease remains high , ranging from 35 % to 65 % ( 4 ) .
Although mechanical ventilation provides essential life support , it can worsen lung injury ( 5 ) .
Ventilator-induced lung injury is caused by excessive stress or strain to lung tissues that occurs during mechanical ventilation and aggravates inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage ( 5 , 13 ) .
Lung-protective ventilation strategies include ventilation with low Vt and limited airway pressure to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury from overdistention while allowing hypercapnia and medium to high positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) to keep alveoli open throughout the ventilator cycle ( 14 ) .
Hypercapnia and acidosis may increase intracranial pressure , induce pulmonary hypertension , depress myocardial contractility , decrease renal blood flow , and release endogenous catecholamines ( 15 ) .
In addition , prevention of cyclic derecruitment with higher PEEP may contribute to overdistention of normally aerated alveoli , counterbalancing the benefits from low Vt and limited airway pressure ventilation cycles ( 14 ) .
This may explain why most critically ill patients are still ventilated with high Vt at lower or even no PEEP ( 4 , 25 ) .
Our objective was to determine whether the different lung-protective ventilatory strategies improve outcome in critically ill adults with acute lung injury or ARDS .
Methods Data Sources and Search es We aim ed to identify all RCTs assessing the efficacy and outcomes of lower Vt ventilation , higher PEEP application , or a combination of both in adults with acute lung injury or ARDS ."

The Editors Chronic diseases are conditions that are usually incurable .
Although often not immediately life-threatening , they place substantial burdens on the health , economic status , and quality of life of individuals , families , and communities ( 1 ) .
Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 10 % of persons 65 years of age and older and increases the risk for other chronic conditions , including ischemic heart disease , renal disease , and visual impairment ( 2 ) .
Despite this enthusiasm , experts do not agree on the definition of what constitutes a chronic disease self-management program , which elements of self-management programs are essential regardless of the clinical condition , or which elements are important for specific conditions .
Several recent review s on chronic disease  self-management  interventions have been published , including 2 Cochrane collaborations ( 6 - 13 ) .
Almost all have been disease-specific .
Almost all previous review s have been disease-specific or addressed specific intervention components within specific disease conditions ( 14 - 17 ) .
In our review , we sought to quantitatively assess chronic disease self-management  programs for older adults within and across disease conditions .
We used empirical data from the literature to address 2 research questions : First , do chronic disease self-management programs result in improved disease-related outcomes for specific chronic diseases of high prevalence in older adults ?
Second , if self-management interventions are effective , are there specific components that are most responsible for the effect , within or across disease conditions ?
To address these questions , we focused on evaluating the effect of self-management programs  for the 3 chronic conditions that have been most commonly studied in controlled trials of older adults : osteoarthritis , diabetes mellitus , and hypertension .
On the basis of a conceptual framework derived from the clinical literature and from discussion s with social scientists with expertise in self-management , we defined chronic disease self-management as a systematic intervention that is targeted toward patients with chronic disease .
We attempted to underst and the characteristics particular to chronic disease self-management programs that may be most responsible for their effectiveness ."

179,27820156,"Similarly , subjects with rheumatoid arthritis have significantly increased periodontal attachment loss .","REVIEW OBJECTIVE The objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesis e the best available evidence to examine whether periodontal disease is a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis .
BACKGROUND Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology and has a complex multifactorial pathogenesis affecting joints and other tissues .
The natural history of rheumatoid arthritis is poorly defined ; its clinical course fluctuates and the prognosis unpredictable .
Rheumatoid arthritis affects up to 1 - 3 % of the population , with a 3:1 female preponderance disappearing in older age .
There is also evidence of a genetic predisposition to the disease .
Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by progressive and irreversible damage of the synovial-lined joints causing loss of joint space , bone and function , leading to deformity .
Extracellular matrix degradation is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis which is responsible for the typical destruction of cartilage , ligaments , tendons , and bone .
Rheumatoid arthritis is characteristically a symmetric arthritis ( symmetrical swelling of the joints ) .
Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation , with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints .
Extra-articular signs can involve pulmonary , cardiovascular , nervous , and reticuloendothelial systems .
The clinical presentation of rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis varies , but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of the small joints is the most frequent finding .
Rheumatoid arthritis onset is acute or subacute in about 25 % of patients .
Early rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by symmetric polyarthritis involving the small joints of the h and s and feet with no radiologic changes .
Rheumatoid arthritis most frequently affects the metacarpophalangeal , proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints .
Although any joint , including the cricoarytenoid joint , can be affected , the distal interphalangeal , the sacroiliac and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved , which is peculiar because these are some of the most typical targets of seronegative spondylarthropathies , such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis .
The clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis vary , depending on the involved joints and the disease stage .
The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning .
Morning stiffness in and around the joints , lasting at least 1 hour before maximal improvement is a typical sign of rheumatoid arthritis .
It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness .
Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity .
Progression of rheumatoid arthritis can be measured by laboratory tests and clinical evaluation ( question naires of disease activity and physical examination ) .
Laboratory tests include blood tests for Rheumatoid factor ( RF ) and Acute-phase reaction tests while clinical evaluation can be measured by the Disease activity using the Disease Activity Score ( DAS ) .
Periodontitis is a destructive inflammatory disease of the dental supporting tissues which leads to erosion of bone around teeth result ing in tooth loss .
Severe periodontitis affects about 5 - 15 % of the adult population .
In periodontitis , the clinical findings of bone resorption and loss of clinical attachment level around tooth are a result of inflammatory mediated alterations to the bone remodelling balance .
The inflammatory infiltrate present between the plaque biofilm , bone and connective tissues regulate the host immune response to the bacteria .
The host produces proteases and substances that de grade the extracellular matrix , and lead to resorption of the alveolar bone , result ing in irreversible loss of tissue attachment .
Bone is a dynamic tissue and bone homeostasis involves the opposing events of resorption and apposition ; dissolution of the existing bone mineral , resorption of the extracellular matrix , and formation of a new matrix .
Bone homeostasis mechanisms maintain bone integrity in the alveolar bone ( regulates periodontal bone loss ) and , elsewhere in the body .
It also functions to regulate the calcium balance within the body ; this is an important ion as it is involved in the clotting of blood , formation of gl and ular secretions and regulation of the cardiac pacemaker .
Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis are arguably the most prevalent chronic inflammatory diseases in humans and associated with significant morbidities .
Both rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis present an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines , which is thought to be responsible for the tissue damage .
In this sense , both conditions are associated with destruction of bone , mediated by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 , tumour necrosis factor and prostagl and in E2.Several studies have suggested a relationship between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis ; rheumatoid arthritis may have a negative impact on periodontal condition and vice versa .
Mercado et al. in 2001 reported a significantly high prevalence of moderate to severe periodontitis in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis .
In addition , the converse is true : periodontitis patients have a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis compared to the general population .
One hypothesis that links rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis is the recently published "" two-hit "" model that attempts to link experimental evidence from animal models and is supported by evidence from human clinical studies .
In this theory , the first "" hit "" involves the periodontopathic subgingival biofilm and its microbial products , such as endotoxin .
The second "" hit "" involves a medical systemic disease , such as rheumatoid arthritis , which increases biomarkers of systemic inflammation in the circulation , including C reactive protein ( CRP ) , cytokines ( e.g. IL-6 ) , prostanoids ( e.g. PGE2 ) , and matrix metalloproteinases ( e.g. MMP-9 ) , and tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF- α ) .
These cytokines are thought to stimulate resident cells in the synovium and the periodontium to produce MMPs mediating connective tissue destruction , and induce the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts to destroy bone In particular , TNF-α , also promotes bone resorption : ( i ) by up-regulating inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) and the production of nitric oxide ( NO ) ; and ( ii ) by modulating the receptor activator of nuclear factor _ B ( NF_B ) lig and ( RANKL ) in osteoblasts , and its antagonist osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) , thus altering the RANKL/OPG ratio , which enhances osteoclast activity , and finally , lead to periodontal breakdown .
Aggressive periodontitis is rapid progression of periodontal disease with severe periodontal breakdown .
As no systematic review has been identified as been either published or underway on this topic , the aim of this systematic review is to identify and synthesis e the best available evidence of periodontal disease as a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis"

Associations with adult disease indicators were not so clear-cut .
Increased size at birth and in childhood were positively associated with adult body-mass index and to a lesser extent with blood pressure values , but not with blood glucose concentrations .

708,12065068,"RESULTS - SUMMARY OF BENEFITS : The gains in duration of survival with the new drugs are modest - a few months - but worthwhile in a condition for which the untreated survival is only about 5 months .
There are also gains in quality of life compared with BSC , because on balance the side-effects of some forms of chemotherapy have less effect on quality of life than the effects of uncontrolled spread of cancer .
In first-line treatment , vinorelbine , gemcitabine , and the lower-dose paclitaxel plus cisplatin combinations generally performed well against BSC under a range of different scenarios and especially when given as a maximum of 3 cycles .
At the very least , gains in duration of survival were achieved without diminution of quality of life ( at best , they improved quality ) and with relatively low incremental cost .
The use of more modern and costly antiemetics would have a modest detrimental effect on cost-effectiveness .
The new drugs for non-small-cell lung cancer extend life by only a few months compared with BSC , but appear to do so without net loss in quality of life and at a cost per LYG that is much lower than for many other NHS activities .
Depending on assumptions used , these new drugs range from being cost-effective , as conventionally accepted , to being cost-saving .","BACKGROUND The incidence of lung cancer is declining following a drop in smoking rates , but it is still the leading cause of death from cancer in Engl and and Wales , with about 30,000 deaths a year .
Survival rates for lung cancer are poor everywhere , but they appear to be better in the rest of the European Community and the USA than in the UK .
Only about 5 per cent of people with lung cancer survive for 5 years , and nearly all of these are cured by surgery after fortuitously early diagnosis .
At present , only a small proportion of patients ( probably about 5 per cent ) with non-small-cell lung cancer are being given chemotherapy .
Some centres treat a greater proportion .
OBJECTIVES This review examines the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of four of the newer drugs - vinorelbine , gemcitabine , paclitaxel and docetaxel - used for treating the most common type of lung cancer ( non-small-cell lung cancer ) .
The first three drugs are used for first-line treatment , but at present docetaxel is used only after first-line chemotherapy has failed .
RESULTS - COSTS : The total cost to the NHS of using these new drugs in Engl and and Wales might be about GBP 10 million per annum , but is subject to a number of factors .
CONCLUSIONS - IMPLICATION S OF THE NEWER DRUGS : One of the present constraints on chemotherapy is availability of inpatient beds .
The advent of newer and gentler forms of chemotherapy given on an outpatient basis would not only overcome this , but it would allow more patients to be treated .
This might apply particularly to older patients .

Gap is observed in exploring the social/economical and spiritual supportive care needs of women with breast cancer survivors as well as practical needs","INTRODUCTION Worldwide , breast cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death ( after lung , stomach , liver and colon cancer ) , while among women it is first on the list .
The incidence of breast cancer has made a dramatic increase since 1970 which is partly interpreted by the modern western life st and ards .
The expected risk of breast cancer throughout a lifespan of an average is 1 in 11 women .
The five-year survival rates for breast cancer are at 80 % if it has not spread , and only at 40 % for the metastatic type of cancer .
The concept of survival comes from the US , where there is an active promotion of self-help difficulties coping strategies .
Surviving from cancer may be a mixed experience .
Survivors of cancer often say they are still running a full and meaningful life after experiencing a threatening disease .
Others may find it difficult to h and le the feeling that they have no right to be alive , which is probably related to the guilt of survival after the war .
Although the survival potential for some is a satisfactory fee , others may be looking for improvement , change , or to adapt their life and struggle with the late effects of cancer after stopping the treatment .
In recent years it has been observed that survival of women with breast cancer  has increased significantly because of current antineoplastic therapeutic interventions .
The definition of support needs derives from the one of supportive care considering that there is no theoretical framework or specific definition at the moment . ""
It includes the period before the final diagnosis , during the diagnosis and the treatments or during the ongoing disease with recurrences and the survivors of the disease . ""

We are uncertain whether intradermal fractional-dose ( one-fifth ) IPV has better protective effects and causes fewer adverse events in children than intramuscular full-dose IPV","BACKGROUND Poliomyelitis is a debilitating and deadly infection .
Despite exponential growth in medical science , there is still no cure for the disease , which is caused by three types of wild polioviruses : types 1 , 2 , and 3 .
According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) , wild poliovirus is still in circulation in three countries , and fresh cases have been reported even in the year 2018 .
Due to the administration of live vaccines , the risk for vaccine-derived poliovirus ( VDPV ) is high in areas that are free from wild polioviruses .
This is evident based on the fact that VDPV caused 20 outbreaks between 2000 and 2011 .
Recent recommendations from the World Health Organization favoured the inclusion of inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) in the global immunisation schedule .
IPV can be delivered in two ways : intramuscularly and intradermally .

Fish oils that contain higher amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ; 20:5n-3 ) than docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ; 22:6n-3 ) , in a distinctive ratio of 18/12 , are typically the most abundantly available and are commonly studied .
Although the two fatty acids have traditionally been considered together , as though they were one entity , different physiological effects of EPA and DHA have recently been reported .
New oils containing a higher quantity of DHA compared with EPA , such as fractionated and concentrated fish oil , tuna oil , calamari oil and microalgae oil , are increasingly becoming available on the market , and other oils , including those extracted from genetically modified oilseed crops , soon to come .
This systematic review focuses on the effects of high DHA fish oils on various human health conditions , such as the  heart and cardiovascular system , the brain and visual function , inflammation and immune function and growth/Body Mass Index ."

Approximately 15 % of patients have a severe attack requiring hospitalization at some time during their illness .
These patients are traditionally treated with intravenous corticosteroids , with a response rate of approximately 60 % .
The patients who do not respond to steroid treatment  usually require surgical removal of the large bowel ( proctocolectomy or colectomy with an anal pouch  ) .
This surgical procedure essentially cures the patient from the disease but is associated with complications such as pouchitis .
Few alternative treatments exist for severe ulcerative colitis : immunosuppressive medications ( such as azathioprine ) have a slow onset of action and are therefore usually ineffective .
Antibiotics are not proven to be effective and biological treatments such as infliximab are still under investigation .

Pre-eclampsia is considerably more prevalent in low-income than in high-income countries .
One possible explanation for this discrepancy is dietary differences , particularly calcium deficiency .

As a result , vaccine-preventable diseases still occur .
In an era of increasing complexity of immunization schedules , rising expectations about the performance of primary care , and large dem and s on primary care providers , it is important to underst and and promote interventions that work in primary care setting s to increase immunization coverage .
One common theme across immunization programs in many nations involves the challenge of implementing a population -based approach and identifying all eligible recipients , for example the children who should receive the measles vaccine .
However , this issue is gradually being addressed through the availability of immunization registries and electronic health records .
A second common theme is identifying the best strategies to promote high vaccination rates .
Three types of strategies have been studied : ( 1 ) patient-oriented interventions , such as patient reminder or recall , ( 2 ) provider interventions , and ( 3 ) system interventions , such as school laws .
One of the most prominent intervention strategies , and perhaps best studied , involves patient reminder or recall systems .

While no first-choice screening option has been established in our setting thus far , any one of those discussed below is more effective than non-screening .","In these tumors , mortality data do not reflect the true incidence of this disease , since survival has improved in recent years , particularly in younger individuals .
In contrast to other European countries , Spain ranks in an intermediate position in terms of CRC-related incidence and mortality .
This risk clearly increases with age , with a notorious rise in incidence from 50 years of age on .
Survival following CRC detection and management greatly depends upon tumor stage at the time of diagnosis ; hence the importance of early detection and –because of their malignant potential– of the recognition and excision of colorectal adenomas .
Thus , polypectomy and then surveillance are the primary cornerstones in the prevention of CRC ( 1 - 4 ) .
For primary prevention , fiber-rich diets , physical exercising , and the avoidance of overweight , smoking , and alcohol have been recommended .
Low-dose NSAIDs or ASA are still not recommended for the prevention of CRC as of today ( 1 ) .
CRC develops through well-established stages from lesions in colonic gl and crypts to adenomas to cancer .
The adenoma-carcinoma sequence is characterized by cumulative mutations in both suppressor genes and oncogenes , which affect the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis ; thus , each mutational event confers tumor cells with a growth advantage entailing a clonal expansion along multiple stages , and ultimately tumor progression ( 5 ) .
From all the above , CRC screening is warranted : a ) this tumor has a high incidence and results in severe morbidity and mortality ; b ) the premalignant potential of colorectal adenomas is well known ; c ) the tumor may be detected using highly sensitive endoscopic techniques ; and d ) early management improves survival .
The population with a moderate risk for CRC includes individuals older than 50 years with no additional risk factors ( family members with CRC or adenomas , chronic inflammatory bowel disease ) .

ICS-induced growth suppression seems to be maximal during the first year of therapy and less pronounced in subsequent years of treatment .","BACKGROUND Treatment guidelines for asthma recommend inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) as first-line therapy for children with persistent asthma .
Although ICS treatment is generally considered safe in children , the potential systemic adverse effects related to regular use of these drugs have been and continue to be a matter of concern , especially the effects on linear growth .
OBJECTIVES To assess the impact of ICS on the linear growth of children with persistent asthma and to explore potential effect modifiers such as characteristics of available treatments ( molecule , dose , length of exposure , inhalation device ) and of treated children ( age , disease severity , compliance with treatment ) .
However , additional studies are needed to better characterise the molecule dependency of growth suppression , particularly with newer molecules ( mometasone , ciclesonide ) , to specify the respective role of molecule , daily dose , inhalation device and patient age on the effect size of ICS , and to define the growth suppression effect of ICS treatment over a period of several years in children with persistent asthma .

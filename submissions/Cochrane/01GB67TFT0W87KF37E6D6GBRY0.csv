1,CD008120,"Study findings suggest that risperidone at low doses may represent a useful tool in the management of symptomatic GAD patients. Although conclusions are considered preliminary based on the relatively small sample size, our data do not support the addition of quetiapine to continued paroxetine CR for individuals with GAD who remain symptomatic after 10 weeks of prospective antidepressant pharmacotherapy and suggest that further research examining strategies for GAD refractory to antidepressants is needed. Further exploration of the benefits of risperidone in patients with more severe GAD may be indicated. Olanzapine may have a salutary effect on anxiety for some GAD patients remaining symptomatic despite initial serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy, but the emergence of significant weight gain represents an important clinical consideration. Additional studies of olanzapine as a treatment for SAD are warranted. Additionally, quetiapine showed a large effect size on the SPIN."
2,CD002968,"Short-term CWT therefore may provide a practical exercise alternative in the lifestyle management of this condition. Additional benefits of improved muscular strength and LBM identify high-intensity resistance training as a feasible and effective component in the management program for older patients with type 2 diabetes. These beneficial effects in reflectory autonomic regulation and glucose control caused by exercise may be associated with improved prognosis of type 2 diabetes patients. CT is an effective method of training that improved functional capacity, lean body mass, strength and glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The improved insulin sensitivity is related to loss of abdominal subcutaneous and visceral AT and to increased muscle density. These data indicate that a low-to-moderate level of aerobic training, independent of dietary changes, is an effective and feasible method of improving cardiovascular risk factors: physical fitness, systolic blood pressure, plasma triglycerides, and glycemic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. Physical training resulted in an improvement in insulin sensitivity with concomitant loss of VAT and should be included in the treatment program for patients with NIDDM. Increased insulin response is at least one main mechanism of the action of exercise. The improvement in metabolic control persisted significantly in patients who continued to exercise at varying levels at home during 1 year of follow-up. These results suggest that RT is an effective form of exercise training which modestly improves glycaemic control and lowers fasting insulin levels in obese type 2 diabetics. The improved beta-cell function does not require changes in insulin sensitivity and Hb A(1c) concentration."
3,CD008472,"Large-scale trials are required to determine whether RIPC confers clinical benefits. This small pilot trial was unable to detect an effect on clinical endpoints; further trials are warranted. This trial could not confirm that remote IP reduces renal injury following elective open aneurysm surgery. In patients undergoing elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, RIPC reduces the incidence of postoperative myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, and renal impairment."
4,CD006373,"This study suggests that a voice treatment approach of VFEs and VH education improved self-reported voice symptoms and voice care knowledge in a group of teachers. Voice therapy with TFL as a therapy tool was effective and more efficient than traditional voice therapy. The results suggest that group voice therapy seems to be an effective method to treat students with mild voice disorders. Voice therapy is effective in improving voice quality as assessed by self rated and observer rated methods. Fourteen out of 15 patients (93%) in treatment group showed significant changes in voice quality."
5,CD007033,"Budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (Symbicort) maintains the benefit of treatment optimisation, stabilising lung function and delaying exacerbations more effectively than either component drug alone or placebo. Because inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists and corticosteroid combination treatment produces better control of symptoms and lung function, with no greater risk of side-effects than that with use of either component alone, this combination treatment should be considered for patients with COPD. We conclude that FSC improved lung function and reduced the severity of dyspnea compared with individual components and placebo. Treatment with FSC (FP, 250 microg, and SM, 50 microg) twice daily substantially improved morning lung function and sustained these improvements for over a period of 24 weeks compared with FP or SM treatment alone in patients with COPD, with no additional safety concerns for the combination treatment vs that with the individual components. Both budesonide/formoterol pMDI dosage strengths were well tolerated relative to the monocomponents and placebo. These results suggest a role for budesonide/formoterol in the long-term management of moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
6,CD004366,"Endurance exercise may help to achieve substantial improvement in the mood of selected patients with major depression in a short time. Placebo response rates were high, suggesting that a considerable portion of the therapeutic response is determined by patient expectations, ongoing symptom monitoring, attention, and other nonspecific factors. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. Because exercise was associated with a modest improvement in depressive symptoms at 10 weeks, older people with poorly responsive depressive disorder should be encouraged to attend group exercise activities. Overall, the results of the study suggest that energy-regulating systems are implicated in the antidepressant action of the non-drug treatments. These results indicate that, at least in the short term, exercise has a broader effect compared with control conditions in reducing depressive symptoms in the moderately depressed elderly. However, exercise has the added benefit of improving physical functioning as well. Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. In neither trial was there any correlation between the extent of change in the subjects' physical fitness due to aerobic exercise and the extent of the improvement of psychiatric scores. (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. More research is needed to clarify the relative benefits of different types of exercise in conjunction with or without pharmacological intervention. Randomized placebo controlled trials are needed to confirm the results. The findings of this study suggest that a group jogging exercise may be effective in improving depressive state, hormonal response to stress and physiological fitness of adolescent females with depressive symptoms. These results provide the first controlled evidence concerning the effects of strenuous exercise on depression. Although antidepressants may facilitate a more rapid initial therapeutic response than exercise, after 16 weeks of treatment exercise was equally effective in reducing depression among patients with MDD. PRT is an effective antidepressant in depressed elders, while also improving strength, morale, and quality of life."
7,CD010256,"Overall, the aminophylline infusion was superior as it significantly reduced the length of stay in hospital. It was concluded that in the doses and routes of administration compared, salbutamol was as effective as aminophylline. Hydrocortisone was given after 2 hours, but did not appear to affect the rate of recovery. The results show that intravenous aminophylline is superior to intravenous salbutamol in the doses given in the initial treatment of acute asthma and that the combination when given intravenously is not better than aminophylline alone. Theophylline should be considered for use early in the management of critically ill asthmatic children."
8,CD004409,"These advantages were not purchased at a price, since the cost of providing this form of care for these patients has cost less than care provided by the district general hospital."
9,CD003075,"The study emphasises the importance of blood pressure control in patients with peripheral vascular disease and hypercholesterolaemia. In patients with POAD at increased risk for restenosis, the administration of high dose verapamil prevented recurrent stenosis for 6 months after successful peripheral angioplasty and was well tolerated. Ramipril prevented major cardiovascular events in patients with clinical as well as subclinical PAD. This trial shows that ACE-inhibition with perindopril represents a simple, safe, and effective short-term therapeutic option for the large proportion of patients with mild essential hypertension and concomitant diseases and therapies."
10,CD003225,"Both drugs were generally well tolerated and the number of reported side-effects was similar to those reported during the run-in period (placebo). The safety of propranolol and its lack of serious side effects were demonstrated. In conclusion, non-selective beta-blockade (propranolol) significantly increases the platelet aggregability compared to beta 1-selective blockade (metoprolol). Improvement of migraine index was not related to different plasma levels of the two drugs. Both active treatments were well tolerated. It can therefore be concluded that cyclandelate as well as propranolol are two comparable substances in the prophylactic treatment of migraine, with cyclandelate showing fewer side effects. In individuals using flunarizine (alone or associated with propranolol) the therapeutic effect was largely maintained up to 45 days after drug withdrawal. In three patients the frequency actually increased over the placebo effect. The number of sickleave days and the use of symptomatic drugs were both less on propranolol treatment than on clonidine, but there was no statistically conclusive difference. No significant difference was identified between divalproex and propranolol for the prophylaxis of migraine without aura. In addition, no significant differences between the three treatments were found with regard to safety: all three treatments were generally well-tolerated and safe. Two and 4 months after treatment withdrawal, most subjects with a negative response to the post-treatment test maintained treatment benefit, whereas benefit was lost in patients with an early onset migraine response. All three groups reported improvement, the most noticeable being in those patients who received 80 mg of nadolol daily. The low incidence of generally mild side-effects with flunarizine may make it preferable to many of the agents at present in use for migraine prophylaxis. Nevertheless, due to the infrequent subjective side effects associated with femoxetine treatment it may be a valuable prophylactic drug to a subgroup of migraine patients. Although propranolol, which is considered a reference for the interval treatment of migraine, is more effective, 5-hydroxytryptophan is a possible alternative for many patients. It is concluded that timolol and propranolol are equally effective in the used doses (1:8) for common migraine prophylaxis. Flunarizine is at least as effective as propranolol in the prophylactic treatment of migraine and may have a better safety profile. In both groups no severe side effects were observed. Summarizing, it may be stated that the studies proved the efficacy of flunarizine to be rather similar to that of propranolol in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. None of the observed side effects led to a withdrawal from treatment. Beta blockers thus appear to have a significant effect on the increased excitability of the visual system in patients with migraine, although their action is not directly related to their reduction of migraine frequency. The results indicate that beta-receptor blocking properties, but possibly also properties other than the beta-blocking ones, may be of importance for the anti-migraine effect of propranolol. The biochemical tests and the type of psychological profile cannot be used to predict drug response. No significant change was found in the hormones levels during nimodipine treatment. The study suggests that mefenamic acid and propranolol are equally effective for migraine prophylaxis. The results and methodological assumptions of the double blind studies with cross over already under consideration in the literature are discussed. Side effects were the cause of premature discontinuation of study medicine in 9 patients during propranolol treatment (dizziness, fatigue, and fall in blood pressure) and in 5 patients during tolfenamic acid treatment (gastrointestinal symptoms). We conclude that nifedipine is not an agent of first choice for the prophylaxis of migraine. The effectiveness of neither drug correlated with a decrease in anxiety or depression demonstrated by psychological testing. Discussion concerns the effects of the chronically given 5-HT agonists and antagonists as well as the possible receptor mechanism underlying "craving for serotonin" in severe M. The increase of 5-HT supersensitivity evidenced at the end of M attacks is also discussed and its role in determining the interruption of the attack is here suggested. It was concluded that the prophylactic effect of tolfenamic acid 300 mg/day in migraine was at least as good as propranolol 120 mg/day. The study showed that partial depletion of thrombocyte 5-HT uptake inhibitor did not lead to a marked improvement in headache, contrary to what might be expected on the grounds of the 5-HT hypothesis of migraine. Both drugs reduced the migraine symptoms compared to the run-in period and were generally well tolerated."
11,CD008012,"clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00042198. Our results suggest that sertraline is a safe and effective treatment for recurrent depression in patients with recent MI or unstable angina and without other life-threatening medical conditions. isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN15858091. CBT holds promise for improving depression and immunity and reducing infection and inflammation after CABG. The implications of this study are discussed with respect to patient management and models for future studies of anxiety in postoperative patient populations. Mirtazapine seems to be safe in the treatment of post-MI depression. Nortriptyline treatment was associated with a significantly higher rate of serious adverse cardiac events compared with paroxetine. Patient convenience, ease of delivery, and the effectiveness of the intervention suggest that the counseling can help patients adjust to chronic illness. The intervention improved depression and social isolation, although the relative improvement in the psychosocial intervention group compared with the usual care group was less than expected due to substantial improvement in usual care patients. In depressed patients who have survived the acute phase of an MI sertraline facilitates the rate of recovery of SDNN, a recognized predictor of clinical outcome. The results of this study suggest that fluoxetine can be safely used to treat patients with post-MI depression beginning 3 months after the event."
12,CD000978,"Oral aloe vera did not improve tolerance to head-and-neck radiotherapy, decrease mucositis, reduce soreness, or otherwise improve patient well-being. The unanticipated improvement in survival outcomes warrants further hypothesis-driven investigation and validation. However, the tolerance of this twice daily amifostine schedule was relatively poor. Filgrastim may decrease the severity of radiation-induced oral/oropharyngeal mucositis. Topical application of natural honey is a simple and cost-effective treatment in radiation mucositis, which warrants further multi-centre randomised trials to validate our finding. We conclude that palifermin was generally safe in allogeneic HSCTs but had no significant effect on engraftment, acute GVHD, or survival in this trial. In this proof of principle study, morning RT was associated with significantly less weight loss after 5 months and an apparent reduction in oral mucositis in a subset of patients receiving >/=66 Gy and in patients who smoked during therapy. The impact of zinc on tumor growth and patient survival is under further investigation. The benefit derived from the pastilles should materially increase patient tolerance to radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. The balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of HDC should be investigated further in order to acquire a clinically effective topical medication based on its anti-inflammatory properties. Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society. In conclusion, selective oral flora elimination in head and neck irradiation patients does not prevent the development of severe mucositis. In conclusion, the present study confirms that cryotherapy can decrease 5FU-induced stomatitis and should be recommended for patients receiving bolus 5FU-containing regimens. GM-CSF can significantly reduce the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis after PFL chemotherapy. Further studies of cytokines are warranted, to assess the feasibility of increasing the total doses of accelerated radiotherapy given, with the aim of improving tumour cure rates. These data demonstrate that the tested allopurinol mouthwash regimen does not offer any protective effect against 5-FU-induced mucositis. Further studies, however, will be necessary to define the role of glutamine supplementation in FU/LV-induced mucositis/stomatitis. Future studies should evaluate higher palifermin doses with longer and more standardized assessment of acute mucositis. A clinically meaningful biologic effect was also suggested in that patients treated with the epithelial growth factor KGF had a lower rate of grade 2 to 4 mucositis than did patients treated with placebo. Antitumor treatment efficacy was preserved. We did not find any evidence to indicate that prophylaxis with GM-CSF mouthwash can help to reduce the severity of mucositis in the setting of the patients we studied. The authors continue to recommend the use of 30 minutes of oral cryotherapy for patients receiving bolus intensive courses of 5-FU-based chemotherapy. The results presented indicate that PGE is not effective for prophylaxis of oral mucositis in BMT recipients. Sucralfate prophylaxis is effective and easy to apply in the protection of mucosa during irradiation therapy. It was concluded that the dose and schedule of glutamine used in this clinical trial does not alleviate 5-FU-induced mucositis. These results strongly support the idea that G-CSF can effectively treat and prevent ADM-induced oral mucositis. The possible reasons for this apparent lack of benefit are discussed. Future clinical study is planned to develop this drug for use in OM management in patients with cancer. Amifostine is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of acute mucositis, acute and late xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients. Further studies need to be done on a larger sample to find the mechanism. Therefore, it is highly assumable that polaprezinc is potentially useful for prevention of oral mucositis and improvement of quality of life without reducing the tumor response. Prospective randomized double-blind studies would verify this role of an oral enzyme therapy as standard co-medication with radiation therapy to the head and neck region. Repifermin given before and after auto-HSCT seems to be active in reducing mucositis, but a larger trial will be necessary to determine the efficacy of repifermin with this dose schedule. The use of amifostine reduces the incidence and severity of acute and late toxicities associated with RCT whilst preserving antitumour activity. These results suggest that herpes simplex virus is not a frequent cause or complication of oral lesions afflicting this patient population. Patient-reported pain was significantly lower and activities were significantly better in the cryotherapy group. The subcutaneous route is much simpler and saves time compared with the intravenous route of administration and can be safely and effectively applied in the daily, busy radiotherapy practice. Benzydamine oral rinse seems to be effective, safe, and well tolerated for prophylactic treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis in head and neck tumours. For patients with head-and-neck cancer receiving CRT, intravenous L-alanyl-L-glutamine may be an effective preventive measure to decrease the severity of mucositis. opioids among patients treated with myeloablative therapy before BMT. In conclusion, we cannot recommend Na SOS in the routine management of radiation-induced skin and mucosal reactions. Prevention of mucositis allows reduction in morbidity of one of the therapy limiting complications of radiotherapy for cancer therapy. The analysis showed that the higher education level and the use of dentures significantly reduced the occurrence of mucositis, and allopurinol mouth rinse (1 mg/ml) was ineffective in the prophylaxis of fluorouracil-induced mucositis. The results of the present study do not support the use of chlorhexidine mouthrinses in patients who are able to maintain good oral hygiene by mechanical means during their illness. We conclude that amifostine can be safely administered prior to high-dose melphalan and significantly reduces the frequency and severity of therapy-induced oral mucositis. Oral glutamine appears to be a simple and useful measure to increase the comfort of many patients at high risk of developing mouth sores as a consequence of intensive cancer chemotherapy. The results suggest that SOD is a safe and effective agent to attenuate the radiotherapy reactions. It may shorten the duration of > or = Grade 3 subjective mucositis. Chinese medicine treatment did not affect the short-term clinical outcome. Further investigation is needed to determine whether palifermin use will facilitate greater adherence to chemotherapy regimens by reducing mucositis. A major impact of Iseganan on reducing stomatitis, UOM, or its clinical sequelae in patients receiving stomatotoxic therapy was not detected on this study. Sucralfate may reduce the experience of pain during radiation therapy. Amifostine treatment did not affect the clinical outcome. This knowledge may provide a possibility of treating the patients with decreased toxicity to oral mucosa. Selective elimination of AGNB of the oral flora did not result in a reduction of radiation-induced mucositis and therefore does not support the hypothesis that these bacteria play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of mucositis. Palifermin reduced the duration and severity of oral mucositis after intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy for hematologic cancers. Our results suggest that antimicrobial intervention may not meaningfully affect the pathogenesis of radiation-induced OM. We found no evidence indicating that subcutaneously given GM-CSF reduces the severity of radiation-induced mucositis. It is cheap, easy to administer with no serious side effect, and may be routinely used in patients receiving head and neck radiotherapy. The study demonstrated that the proportion of patients with severe mucosal reactions was significantly lower in the sucralfate group than in the placebo group. However, the absent correlation between improved salivary flow and QOL scores is of some concern (though not a new finding) and may be related to the existence of comorbidities and the lack of effect on mucositis. The safety of amifostine and the lack of tumor protection were consistent with previous studies. In control arm 12% had grade I, 76% had grade II, 8% had grade III skin reaction. Further investigation is required regarding clinical tools for determining effectiveness, administration for tolerance and compliance, dosage, and potential of oral glutamine usage. A role for chlorhexidine in the prevention of OM is suggested, which should be evaluated further. Future studies will assess cryotherapy before allogeneic HSCT. On the contrary, the risk of mucositis and clinical sequelae seems to be enhanced, although the counts of micro-organisms on the oral mucous membranes are significantly reduced. In particular, there was no beneficial effect on radiation-induced early oral mucositis. Propantheline is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of mucositis in patients receiving high-dose etoposide. The reductions in mucositis and in oral candida infections observed with prophylactic chlorhexidine mouthrinse represent a significant advantage for patients undergoing marrow transplantation. The results also suggested the potential value of chlorhexidine mouth rinses in the prophylaxis of oral candidiasis in the myelosuppressed patient. In conclusion, suppression of oral flora and a lowering of the severity of mucositis by means of disinfecting mouthrinses were not successful. We found no beneficial effect of 300 micrograms GM-CSF dissolved in a 2% methylcellulose gel applied locally for chemo- and radiotherapy-induced mucositis in patients undergoing a stem cell transplantation. A positive correlation between GM-CSF dose and leukocyte recovery was noted (P = 0.04). 2009 American Cancer Society. The Chinese herbal preparation YHD could alleviate oral mucomembranous reaction to radiation applied in patients with head-neck tumor. A nursing prescription of a systematic oral hygiene program using water as a mouth rinse is cost efficient and may be effective in preventing oral mucositis. The resultant data from this clinical trial did not support the prestudy hypothesis that chamomile could decrease 5-FU-induced stomatitis. On the basis of these findings, we cannot recommend that PTX be part of early mortality and morbidity prevention programs after BMT. Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society. Whether such a lozenge would be beneficial in treatment situations where rate of severe mucositis is higher (ie, in patients treated with unconventional fractionation or with concomitant chemotherapy) is unknown. This study shows that prophylactic use of pure natural honey was effective in reducing mucositis resulting from radiochemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer. Larger randomized trials evaluating amifostine cytoprotection during high-dose chemotherapy are warranted. The results of this pilot study suggest that misoprotol may protect the oral and pharyngeal mucosa from radiation-induced mocositis if adequate time between topical administration and radiation is allowed. It is concluded that rinsing with povidone-iodine reduces the incidence, severity and duration of oral mucositis during antineoplastic radiochemotherapy. Natural honey is a product with rich nutritional qualities that could be a pleasant, simple, and economic modality for the management of radiation mucositis. There is a paucity of high-level evidence on potentially useful interventions and a continued need for new and innovative research, incorporating quality-of-life measurements, in patients experiencing radiation-induced mucositis. However, the exact mechanisms and pathways still need further analysis. When indicating oral rinses, the patient's individual preference and tolerance of solutions offered should be considered. Parenteral Gln may also prevent oral mucositis, although further studies involving more patients need to be undertaken to confirm this and the other results. Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Head Neck 21: 760-766, 1999. In addition, there is a tremendous potential for using LEL in combined treatment protocols utilizing concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The present findings need to be confirmed before adopting GM-CSF mouthwashes in routine clinical use. To improve the radio- and chemoprotective effects of amifostine in clinical practice, the application of a higher dose (> 250 mg) seems to be necessary. Overall, the preventive administration of sucralfate appears to be an effective procedure to diminish the occurrence of severe oral and intestinal mucositis in patients treated by high dose chemotherapy alone or combined with TBI before bone marrow transplantation. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Our results indicate that the use of upfront LPLT in patients who have undergone HSCT is a powerful instrument in reducing the incidence of OM and is now standard in our center. Allopurinol mouth wash showed a marked effect on stomatitis induced by chemotherapy. Patient reporting of mucositis is a more sensitive instrument for assessment of mucositis than review by medical staff. We now routinely recommend this cryotherapy procedure for our patients receiving daily bolus 5FU plus leucovorin. A trend favouring shorter treatment interruptions in the prednisone arm was also found, but not a reduction in the intensity or duration of mucositis. These results should be confirmed by additional evaluation in randomized studies with a larger number of patients. To overcome this problem, the oral medication should have a neutral taste, the solution should not be swallowed after the swishing, which should not be started until the nausea had ceased. In conclusion, rhGM-CSF is well tolerated and reduces post-transplant morbidity in patients undergoing HLA-identical allogeneic BMT. SFR has definite effect in preventing and treating radiation reaction and late stage radiation injury in patients with head and neck tumor. Palifermin administered at the indicated dosing regimen (40 microg/kg for 3 consecutive days) before chemotherapy was well tolerated and resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the incidence of WHO grade 2 or higher OM in patients with metastatic CRC. This study showed no evidence of benefit from the prophylactic use of low-energy laser in children and adolescents with cancer treated with chemotherapy when optimal dental and oral care was provided. Therefore, we do not recommend the prophylactic use of sucralfate in patients with head and neck cancer treated by radiotherapy. Pilocarpine has no benefit for the moderation of the incidence, severity, or duration of mucositis in patients receiving autologous blood stem cell transplantation. We thereby recommend the use of the E2 protocol for delaying the onset of stomatitis and reducing oral injury in nasopharyngeal cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. The significance of a long-term comparison of cure rates would be doubtful considering the heterogeneity of the primary sites and regional disease in this group coupled with the small size of our study. This study demonstrates that use of alcohol-free povidone-iodine mouthwash can reduce the severity and delay the onset of oral mucositis due to antineoplastic radiotherapy. Phase 3 studies are ongoing to confirm these results. on the effectiveness of LLE laser to prevent OM. In contrast to the prestudy hypothesis that a chlorhexidine mouthwash might provide benefit for patients receiving radiation therapy to the oral mucosa, this study provides strong evidence suggesting that a chlorhexidine mouthwash is detrimental in this clinical situation. Individual dental stent is useful in sparing the oral mucous membrane and preserving taste for primary NPC patients in radiotherapy. The benzydamine topical application was more effective than placebo in the control of mucositis symptoms and signs produced by radiotherapy and/or intra-arterial antineoplastic chemotherapy. Prophylactic oral glutamine could ameliorate the neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced increase in intestinal permeability, but had no significant positive clinical effect on stomatitis and diarrhea and did not interfere with the antitumor effect of chemotherapy. In the multivariate analysis, the risk of oral mucositis was related only to the type of chemotherapy regimen, suggesting that further strategies for preventing oral mucositis could be mainly based on these criteria. Sucralfate administration can, however, reduce acquisition of alimentary colonization with potential pathogens, perhaps by interfering with adherence to mucosal membranes. Our results do not support the use of oral misoprostol as administered in this study, for high-dose chemotherapy-induced mucositis prophylaxis. A significant reduction in the incidence of chemotherapy-related oral mucositis occurred across multiple cycles of treatment in patients treated with filgrastim. Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society. Although the trial produced no direct clinical evidence indicating that sucralfate mouth rinses prevent radiation-induced mucositis, the decrease in the salivary lactoferrin and albumin levels suggests that sucralfate has a slight protective effect on the oral mucosa."
13,CD003948,"There was a non-significant trend in favour of the active treatment during the initial double-blind placebo-controlled phase of the trial, and no side-effects were observed. Skin reactions, when present, are well tolerated and only occasionally require cessation of treatment."
14,CD006790,"Larger, randomized trials are, however, warranted to confirm this finding, owing to possible type II errors in group comparisons. Further studies are indicated. IFN-beta-1a may represent a promising novel treatment approach in ulcerative colitis. PegIFN is safe but not effective, at the dosages used, in patients with ulcerative colitis."
15,CD006268,"Patient-controlled administration of propofol and alfentanil for colonoscopy may provide a better margin of safety than conventional administration of midazolam and meperidine and results in a higher level of patient satisfaction and shorter recovery. PCS with propofol is effective and results in high patient satisfaction and faster discharge. PCS provides an acceptable alternative to sedation with midazolam and pethidine with the advantage of significantly faster recovery times, which are of relevance in the outpatient setting. For outpatient colonoscopy, propofol administered by nurses and supervised by endoscopists has several advantages over midazolam plus meperidine and deserves additional investigation. Nurse-administered propofol resulted in several advantages for outpatient colonoscopy compared with midazolam plus fentanyl, but did not improve patient satisfaction. Our data suggest that the synergistic sedation with a low dose of midazolam combined with propofol was superior to a standard combination of midazolam and the opioid pethidine for colonoscopies as far as the patient comfort and recovery times are concerned. Patient-controlled sedation is an effective alternative to premedication with narcotic/benzodiazepine combinations during colonoscopy. The use's safety and the fast recovery with propofol incite to advocate it as an unique+ anaesthetic agent for colonoscopies. Remifentanil provided a smoother haemodynamic profile than propofol; however, the frequent occurrence of remifentanil-induced hypoventilation requires the cautious administration of this agent. Despite higher costs, nurse-administered propofol-alfentanil sedation using a PCA pump can provide deeper conscious sedation, comparable satisfaction, and similar complication risks compared with conventional opioid-benzodiazepine sedation. However, remifentanil-induced nausea and vomiting may be a problem during the recovery phase. It is associated with a high degree of patient comfort and rapid recovery times, and has a potential cost benefit concerning nursing care and bed facilities."
16,CD000980,"Doses of vitamin C in excess of 1 g daily taken shortly after onset of a cold did not reduce the duration or severity of cold symptoms in healthy adult volunteers when compared with a vitamin C dose less than the minimum recommended daily intake. The rationale for investigating D-isoascorbic acid, an isomer of L-ascorbic acid which has limited antiscorbutic activity, is discussed. Vitamin C does not seem to be an effective prophylactic or therapeutic agent for upper respiratory illness. Volunteers were generally impressed by the protection afforded them during the winter months and the general acceptability of the study medication. On the basis of this and other studies it is suggested that the optimum daily dose of vitamin C is less than 250 mg, except possibly at the time of acute illness, when a larger daily intake may be beneficial. This study provides evidence that vitamin C supplementation may enhance resistance to the postrace URT infections that occur commonly in competitive ultramarathon runners and may reduce the severity of such infections in those who are sedentary. Preventive treatment of healthy children with vitamin C in large doses this had no definitely proved effect against colds. No side effects of substantive changes in serum biochemistry could be attributed to the vitamin C dose. This finding warrants further research. Ascorbic acid is of no value in the treatment of the common cold; its preventive effect, if any, is not such as to justify advising its general use as a prophylactic measure. Analysis of these data showed that ascorbic acid had at best only a minor influence on the duration and severity of colds, and that the effects demonstrated might be explained equally well by a break in the double blind. The existence of a subgroup of vulnerable women in the community who benefit from vitamin C was considered but further examination of the data gives no support to this conclusion. This study and the literature do not support the prophylactic use of vitamin C to prevent the common cold. The seven treated twins in the latter group also grew an average of 1.3 cm more than their untreated co-twins during the five-minth period of the study. These results are compatible with the belief that supplementary vitamin C can reduce the burden of winter illness, but the intake need not be as high as has sometimes been claimed. However, considering several limitations due to protocol amendment, the findings should be interpreted with caution."

18,CD001782,"Tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% appears to be safe and effective in the treatment of photodamaged skin. In this 12-week pilot study tazarotene redressed abnormalities associated with photo-damaged skin. We conclude that tretinoin 0.05% cream significantly improved the appearance of photo-damaged skin. Tretinoin emollient cream 0.01% is a potentially safe, effective treatment for photodamaged skin. Medium to deep (Grade III) facial rhytids were improved by 70% with both procedures with no significant difference noted between techniques. Both methods have unique advantages and disadvantages. Side effects were limited to irritation of tretinoin-exposed skin. Subjects treated with Er:YAG laser recover more quickly from the procedure than those receiving CO2 laser treatment. Manual tumescent dermabrasion and 950 microsec dwell time CO2 laser resurfacing are equally effective for the treatment of upper lip wrinkles. In this limited pilot study, no specific benefit could be assigned to the concomitant use of monthly glycolic acid refresher "peels" in the treatment of photodamaged skin. Unneutralized 5% glycolic acid topical cream when used on a regular daily basis can improve some photoaging effects. Tazarotene in a cream formulation is safe and is associated with positive changes in the treatment of photodamaged facial skin. The elasticity index increased from about 50% to 69% on the Vivida-treated side and from 49% to 50% on the placebo-treated side. One can use CO2 laser with one pass to mimic a moderately aggressive Er:YAG laser treatment. The separation between clinical improvement and irritation suggests that mechanisms other than irritation dominate tretinoin-induced repair of photoaging in humans. Topical 0.1 percent tretinoin significantly improves both clinical and microscopical manifestations of liver spots; these lesions do not return for at least six months after therapy is discontinued. Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Side effects of erythema, peeling, and stinging were usually mild and well tolerated. In the Vivida group, five patients developed transient, mild pimples during the first weeks of treatment, but no other adverse effects occurred. No changes were observed in the placebo group and no adverse effects were reported by either treatment group. Skin replica optical profilometry is an objective method for quantification of the skin surface texture changes. Both studies demonstrated that tretinoin cream 0.02% is safe and effective for the treatment of moderate-to-severe photodamaged facial skin. Topical application of 0.1% isotretinoin is an effective and well-tolerated treatment leading to clinically apparent improvement in the appearance of photodamaged skin of the face, forearms, and hands. These agents are well tolerated and available without prescription. Treatment of upper lip wrinkles with Baker's phenol resulted in greater improvement than treatment with the 950 microsec dwell time CO2 laser.

19,CD006355,"Treatment with NTG is not a clear alternative to infiltration of corticosteroids in patients with RCT, because of its lack of effectiveness and because of the greater number of patients who had adverse events that lead them to abandon treatment. We conclude that NTG is useful in the treatment of shoulder pain syndrome caused by supraspinatus tendinitis and that this treatment could be a useful approach to the management of this common disturbance and probably also in other tendon musculoskeletal disorders. Topical glyceryl trinitrate should be included as part of nonsurgical management of chronic tendinopathies."
20,CD003082,"It is both superior to placebo and comparable to haloperidol in reducing positive symptoms at doses ranging from 150 to 750 mg/day and in reducing negative symptoms at a dose of 300 mg/day. Haloperidol was superior to placebo for reduction of target symptoms with optimal haloperidol dose of 0.5 to 3.5 mg/day (0.02-0.12 mg/kg/day). The use of antiparkinson drugs completely controlled the extrapyramidal symptoms. Aripiprazole, effective against positive and negative symptoms, is a safe and well-tolerated potential treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. These data suggest that risperidone, at the optimal therapeutic dose of 6 mg/day, produced significant improvement in both positive and negative symptoms without an increase in drug-induced parkinsonian symptoms and with a significant beneficial effect on tardive dyskinesia. Risperidone is a safe antipsychotic that is effective against both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. These data suggest that neuroleptic treatment for a longer period is vitally important to prevent relapse even in schizophrenics in remission and that such a trial seems an efficient method for investigating the prophylactic effects of neuroleptics. After only 7 days of trazodone treatment, a relatively reliable decision can be established as to whether a therapeutical success can be expected if treatment is continued. The present results indicate that haloperidol is superior to propericiazine from the viewpoint of the wider "therapeutic window" in maintenance treatment and antidopaminergic properties of neuroleptics, wherein it is important to prevent relapse even in remitted schizophrenics. The role of AAG and psychotropic drug disposition in psychiatric patients requires further evaluation. This study suggests that risperidone may offer a superior side-effect profile, and possibly greater efficacy, than a standard neuroleptic such as haloperidol. Prolactin elevations associated with olanzapine were not significantly greater than those observed with placebo and were also significantly less than those seen with haloperidol."
21,CD001543,"The open anterior approach to the groin was associated with demonstrable nerve injury, and laparoscopic TAPP repair was the most effective approach in the hands of an experienced surgeon. Bassini-Stetten and high ligation with ring narrowing are inadequate repairs, regardless of the type of hernia. However, DR is superior in terms of the time taken, post-operative pain, need for analgesia and early ambulation. This might be due to lack of experience. These facts suggest that having more experience with the Shouldice operation makes available the extreme low recurrence rate published by several authors. The recurrences suggest that additional supervision of junior surgeons is required during the Shouldice repair learning period. It was possible to achieve excellent results with this technique in a general surgical unit. The Shouldice inguinal hernia repair may have a role in open primary herniorrhaphy to decrease the risk of chronic groin pain. Multivariate analysis identified the presence of a direct hernia (P = 0.003) as the additional main factor for the development of recurrence. Despite the "tension-free" design of the mesh repair, short-term outcomes of mesh and Shouldice repairs of inguinal hernias do not differ. Open plug and patch repair is a promising technique of hernia repair in adults, because it offers the same excellent patient comfort as the laparoscopic repair but is less expensive and can be performed under local anesthesia. The outcome is better for the patients and it is more cost-effective. The Shouldice hernia repair should be the gold standard for inguinal hernia repair in men and serves as the basis for comparison with all other techniques, be they prosthetic or laparoscopic. The omission of muscle sutures is physiologically sound and recommended for the Shouldice operation. Both types of hernia repair are comparable and effective, but long-term results favor the Lichtenstein technique for reducing recurrences (to a P value of .10), ease of technical mastery, and application to the outpatient setting by use of a local anesthetic."

Ondansetron may be an effective and efficient treatment that reduces the incidence of vomiting from gastroenteritis during both the first 8 h and the next 24 h, and is probably a useful adjunct to oral rehydration. Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society. In children with dehydration secondary to vomiting from acute viral gastritis, ondansetron with intravenous rehydration improves tolerance of oral fluids after two hours and reduces the hospital admission rate when compared with intravenous rehydration with or without dexamethasone. Dimenhydrinate reduces the frequency of vomiting in children with mild dehydration; however, the overall benefit is low, because it does not improve oral rehydration and clinical outcome. Ondansetron was effective in reducing the emesis from gastroenteritis during the ED phase of oral rehydration and in lowering the rates of intravenous fluid administration and hospital admission. In subjects with acute gastritis/acute gastroenteritis and mild to moderate dehydration who failed initial oral rehydration therapy, the proportion of children who received intravenous hydration was smaller in the ondansetron group than in the placebo group."

26,CD003917,"So far, no significant difference in cardiotoxicity has been observed either between the verapamil and nonverapamil group or between the two induction chemotherapy regimens (TAD/TAD - TAD/HAM). It is a selective cytoprotectant without reducing the effect of chemotherapy. By protecting against cumulative doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity, ICRF-187 permits significantly greater doses of doxorubicin to be administered to patients with greater safety. DZR is the first agent shown to reduce cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin. Additional clinical trials with larger numbers of patients are needed to determine if the short-term cardioprotection afforded by ICRF-187 will reduce the incidence of late cardiac complications in long-term survivors of childhood cancer. The clinical use of dexrazoxane should be recommended in patients whose risk of developing cardiotoxicity could hamper the eventual use and possible benefit of epirubicin. Prophylactic use of carvedilol in patients receiving ANT may protect both systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricle. These data demonstrate a protective effect of CoQ on cardiac function during therapy with ANT. ABVE-PC is a dose-dense regimen that provides outstanding event-free survival/overall survival with short duration, early-response-adapted therapy. Although RIS is a sensitive technique in detecting anthracycline cardiac damage, its specificity is low and it cannot be considered a primary test for guiding anthracycline treatment. Biochemical and molecular analyses indicated a stimulation of oxidative metabolism in white blood cells through carnitine uptake. These findings suggest that simultaneous administration of PNL may mitigate ADM cardiotoxicity, but larger trials are needed to draw definite conclusions. Dexrazoxane significantly reduced the occurrence and severity of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction due to previous anthracycline treatment without compromising the antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic regimen. The preliminary results, however, suggest efficient cardioprotection by this cheap and safe antioxidant combination, so that larger studies are warranted for confirmation. Therefore, dexrazoxane can reduce the arrhythmic risk in patients treated with epirubicin. Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society"
27,CD005522,"In this study, addition of tramadol/acetaminophen to NSAID or COX-2-selective inhibitor therapy was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of OA flare pain. Tramadol 37.5 mg/APAP 325 mg combination tablets were effective and safe as add-on therapy with COX-2 NSAID for treatment of OA pain. A once-a-day formulation of tramadol has the potential to provide patients increased control over the management of their pain, fewer interruptions in sleep and improved compliance. Effective pain relief should therefore be the main therapeutic goal in patients with OA where inflammation is less prominent. It appeared to be relatively well tolerated for an opioid compound. Tramadol interfered less with intestinal function and showed greater antinociceptive action. Moreover, they indicate that after oral treatment with tramadol, both the parent drug and its active metabolite can penetrate into synovial fluid. In patients with painful OA of the knee responding to naproxen 1,000 mg/day, the addition of tramadol 200 mg/day allows a significant reduction in the dosage of naproxen without compromising pain relief."
28,CD008838,"The risk of systemic reactions during VIT means that treatment should be given where there is immediate access to resuscitation facilities. We conclude that venom immunotherapy is clinically superior to therapy on whole-body extract or placebo. Prescription of an EpiPen in patients not choosing this treatment is associated with deterioration in HRQL and should therefore be avoided as definitive treatment in these patients. Further studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of venom immunotherapy for large local reactions, the optimal duration of treatment, and the mechanism for the differences in degree and rate of clinical response compared with venom immunotherapy in systemic reactors. Trials involving systemic reactions and dose-ranging studies are needed. Since only 9.2 percent of stings in the untreated children led to a systemic reaction and since there was no progression to a more severe reaction, we conclude that venom immunotherapy is unnecessary for most children who are allergic to insect stings."

31,CD003709,"In further studies, alternative strategies to maintain cardiac index should be explored, such as a synergy between low-dose terlipressin and dobutamine. Clinical trial registered with www.controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN11597444). Copyright 2008 Massachusetts Medical Society. Norepinephrine, however, may have a more favorable hemodynamic profile and improve splanchnic tissue oxygen utilization in sepsis. This effect was probably a result of higher cardiac index. VP is a useful agent in the treatment of refractory septic shock. However, terlipressin was more rapidly effective for maintaining normal systolic arterial blood pressure during general anesthesia. Supplementary AVP infusion in patients with advanced vasodilatory shock and severe postoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome did not compromise cutaneous reactive hyperaemia and flowmotion when compared with norepinephrine infusion alone. There is no evidence for a difference in efficacy and safety between epinephrine alone and norepinephrine plus dobutamine for the management of septic shock. Although no adverse events were noticed in the present study, potential benefits of increasing Svo2 after terlipressin bolus infusion need to be weighted against the risk of cardiovascular complications resulting from high-dose dobutamine. At the same time, oxygen uptake was increased. 2010 Massachusetts Medical Society The increased oxygen demand in the splanchnic region is the main risk factor for splanchnic tissue hypoxia in septic shock. Despite the development of potential drug-related effects with epinephrine, there was no difference in the achievement of a MAP goal between epinephrine and norepinephrine in a heterogenous population of ICU patients. The combined infusion of AVP and NE proved to be superior to infusion of NE alone in the treatment of cardiocirculatory failure in catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock. Patients receiving DA should be monitored for the development of cardiac arrhythmias (NCT00604019). The metabolic and splanchnic effects of the combination of norepinephrine and dobutamine in hyperdynamic dopamine-resistant septic shock appeared to be more predictable and more appropriate to the current goals of septic shock therapy than those of epinephrine alone. AVP decreases NE exposure, has no effect on the PrCO(2) - PaCO(2 )difference, and improves renal function and SOFA score. Terlipressin seems to cause no adverse effect but warrants further evaluation as a rescue therapy in refractory septic shock. The present study provides evidence that continuous infusion of low-dose terlipressin--when given as first-line vasopressor agent in septic shock--is effective in reversing sepsis-induced arterial hypotension and in reducing norepinephrine requirements."
32,CD008870,"5-ASA may be considered as alternative treatment in patients with activer CD who are intolerant to or refuse glucocorticoids. The addition of sulfasalazine, however, offered no advantage. In patients with active Crohn's disease affecting the ileum, the ascending colon, or both, a controlled-ileal-release formulation of budesonide was more effective in inducing remission than a slow-release formulation of mesalamine. The response of active Crohn's disease to sulphasalazine was significantly better than to placebo. 5-Aminosalicylic acid can thus be considered a valuable alternative to conventional treatment on the basis of equal effectiveness as salazosulfapyridine and lack of undesirable side effects. The use of prednisone in addition to sulphasalazine in patients with active Crohn disease results in a significantly faster initial improvement, but not in a significantly better result after 16 weeks of treatment, when disease activity is measured by the Van Hees Activity Index. The meta-analysis of 3 large, double-blind, randomized studies in the treatment of active Crohn's disease confirms that Pentasa 4 g/day is superior to placebo in reducing the CDAI but the clinical significance of the magnitude of this difference is not clear. Nevertheless, trends towards a beneficial effect in Crohn's disease in the small bowel justify further clinical trials with a larger dosage of 5-ASA. No serious adverse reactions occurred. Although the number of patients in this study was relatively small, Asacol 3.2 g/day appears to be safe and effective treatment for mildly to moderately active Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis as compared with placebo, and this regimen is an option for treatment of patients who fail or are intolerant of sulfasalazine. This controlled-release mesalamine preparation is safe and effective at 4 g/day as a single agent in treatment of active Crohn's disease of the ileum and colon. Mesalamine in microgranular formulation seems to be equally as effective as a standard dosage of steroids in the treatment of the mild to moderate form of Crohn's ileitis. These results suggest that this slow-release preparation of 5-ASA should be tested in larger controlled therapeutic trials over a longer period of time. There is less than a 5% risk that a clinically significant prophylactic effect of any of the drug regimens was missed. However, the potential benefit of a higher dose cannot be excluded."
33,CD006194,"We found no correlation between final anatomical and functional outcome, and concluded that the severity of the original soft-tissue injury and its complications are the major determinants of functional end result. We recommend that displaced severely comminuted intra-articular fractures should be treated with an external fixator. Comminuted intraarticular fractures of the distal radius should be treated with external fixation, which maintains accurate anatomic position until solid fracture healing is achieved. The present findings may serve as guidance in physiotherapy for these patients. The external fixator group had a significant complication rate. The main influence on final outcome was carpal malalignment which had a statistically significant negative effect on function. We conclude that, in the long term, external fixation of distal radius fractures does not confer an improved outcome when compared to plaster immobilization. The technique of bipolar fixation proved to be safe and suitable for use in a busy district general hospital, without the necessity of elaborate equipment. After 1 year, the patients allocated to primary external fixation had a better radiographic and functional end result; according to Lidström's grading, 19/22 were excellent or good after external fixation as compared with 12/19 after plaster-cast treatment. For distal radius fractures with metaphyseal displacement but with a congruous joint, there exists a trend for better functional, clinical, and radiographic outcomes when treated by immediate external fixation and optional K-wire fixation. A good anatomic position combined with early rehabilitation of the wrist function produced very favorable functional results in patients less than 45 years of age. We recommend the use of external fixation for young patients with comminuted displaced Colles' fractures unless manipulation and plaster show excellent reduction."

Neither IFN, TMX, nor the combination significantly improved the response rate, TTF, or survival when added to dacarbazine, but IFN significantly increased toxicity. It is concluded that combination treatment regimens utilising interferons together with chemotherapeutic agents deserve further study in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma. Of the three regimens tested, the combination of temozolomide and thalidomide seems the most promising for future study. Temozolomide demonstrates efficacy equal to that of DTIC and is an oral alternative for patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, our treatment schedule was carried out on outpatients and had an acceptable level of toxicity. More toxicity was encountered in the combination arm, which was acceptable except in three patients where treatment was discontinued because of IFN toxicity. The use of combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens is not recommended in the absence of well-designed, prospective, randomized protocols showing the benefit of this treatment strategy.

36,CD001983,"These findings suggest that further studies should be carried out with lower doses of calcitonin or by other better tolerated forms of delivery such as in a nasal spray. However, the lack of effect of calcitonin on the rate of vertebral fractures does not permit its recommendation for routine use in preventing steroid-induced osteoporosis. Intranasal sCT (100 IU/day) appears to have beneficial effects on bone loss at the proximal femur in patients with active RA treated with low dose glucocorticoids for 12 months; longer studies are needed to exclude transient bone remodelling effects. A significant reduction in back pain was a further consequence of the hormone therapy. In rheumatic disease patients starting high-dose, long-term corticosteroids, salmon calcitonin with calcium and vitamin D3 provided no greater bone preservation than that observed with calcium and vitamin D3 alone. Calcitriol and calcium, used prophylactically with or without calcitonin, prevent corticosteroid-induced bone loss in the lumbar spine.

37,CD002988,"It was concluded that in the doses and routes of administration compared, salbutamol was as effective as aminophylline. Addition of a 10 min infusion of salbutamol in the early treatment of children with acute severe asthma has the potential to curtail the clinical progression of asthma, reduce demand placed on hospital resources, and improve the quality of health care provided to the acutely sick child with asthma. In view of the risks of intravenous treatment, especially using high doses, inhaled bronchodilator therapy would seem advisable as initial treatment. We conclude that both the intravenous and inhalational administration of terbutaline are effective in acute severe asthma, but that the intravenous route is possibly better for increasing PaO2. Hydrocortisone was given after 2 hours, but did not appear to affect the rate of recovery. We conclude that, in hypercapnic acute asthma, the nebulized route has a greater efficacy and fewer side effects than the intravenous route. It is concluded that salbutamol given by IPPB is better than that given by slow intravenous injection in severe acute asthma.

38,CD006772,"Ischaemic heart disease is a chronic condition which requires the same systematic approach to secondary prevention applied in other chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus. Effective secondary prevention of coronary heart disease requires more than postal prompts and the dissemination of guidelines. Most patients gained at least one effective component of secondary prevention and, for them, future cardiovascular events and mortality could be reduced by up to a third. Even if the technical problems of producing a system that fully supports the management of chronic disease were solved, there remains the challenge of integrating the systems into clinical encounters where busy practitioners manage patients with complex, multiple conditions. Conventional presentation of practice guidelines had no effect. Understanding the reasons for this is the key next step in improving the quality of care of patients with coronary heart disease.

40,CD007166,"Adverse effects related to the central nervous system were similar to those reported with other dopamine agonists, and the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular tolerability of the compound was satisfactory. Some patients showed improvement, and the "off-periods" were reduced in many cases. Ropinirole 24-hour demonstrated an improvement in both motor and non-motor PD symptoms, while permitting a reduction in adjunctive levodopa dose. Once-daily rasagiline reduces mean daily off-time and improves symptoms of Parkinson's disease in levodopa-treated patients with motor fluctuations, an effect similar to that of entacapone. Entacapone is effective at increasing the duration of response to levodopa and at relieving parkinsonism in patients experiencing motor fluctuations and was well tolerated during the 24 weeks of treatment. Copyright 2004 Movement Disorder Society may provide additional benefit to patients with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease with treated "wearing-off" phenomenon. Copyright 2006 Movement Disorder Society. The conclusion of this trial is that bromocryptine significantly increases the therapeutic effectiveness in these poorly levodopa responding parkinsonian patients. In conclusion, although the primary efficacy variable did not reach statistical significance, the present results demonstrate that entacapone provides additional antiparkinsonian benefits to levodopa therapy and is well tolerated in levodopa-treated PD patients experiencing wearing-off motor fluctuations despite adjunct dopamine agonist therapy. We conclude that tolcapone as an adjunct offers promise for the relief of the "wearing-off" phenomenon in levodopa-treated parkinsonian patients. However, there was no difference between the groups when comparing their average Hoehn and Yahr stage of disease, and Schwab and England activities of daily living index. We conclude that pramipexole-treated patients with advanced PD improved significantly more than placebo for both primary end points. Blackwell Munksgaard 2004 The results of our gait analysis confirmed that in parkinsonian patients with fluctuating motor symptoms levodopa/benserazide, but not tolcapone, produced a substantial improvement. A novel finding was that patients without fluctuations also obtained benefit from the addition of entacapone to their levodopa treatment, as evidenced by improved ADL scores and a relatively reduced levodopa requirement. Continuous delivery of rotigotine as transdermal patches could offer similar efficacy to oral pramipexole in patients with fluctuating Parkinson's disease over 6 months of treatment. In light of recently reported benefits in patients with early illness, rasagiline is a promising new treatment for PD. Copyright 2006 Movement Disorder Society. Pramipexole administration is an efficacious and well tolerated add on therapy in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease with an improvement in activities of daily living, motor function, and treatment associated complications. Copyright 2005 Movement Disorder Society. When the doses of bromocriptine were increased slowly, the adverse reactions were minor and usually transient. The improvement occurred irrespective of the reduction of the levodopa dose. Pramipexole is an effective and well-tolerated therapy, with or without concomitant levodopa, for Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease. Tolcapone prolongs "on" time in fluctuating parkinsonian patients while allowing a reduction in daily levodopa dosage, thereby improving the efficacy of long term levodopa therapy. Entacapone is an effective and safe levodopa extender and enhancer, improving the symptomatic efficacy of levodopa in PD and adding to the patients' benefit. Ropinirole permits a reduction in L-dopa dose with enhanced clinical benefit for PD patients with motor fluctuations. We conclude that cabergoline is an effective adjunct to levodopa for the treatment of PD. Additionally, levodopa requirements were significantly decreased. Tolcapone was effective at prolonging the clinical benefit of levodopa and reducing total levodopa requirements in PD patients with motor fluctuations. Other side effects, such as nausea and mild forms of collapse, could be controlled by drugs. We conclude that deprenyl is of moderate benefit in a majority of patients with symptom fluctuations complicating PD and is generally well tolerated. This study has demonstrated that rasagiline (up to 2 mg/day) has a good safety profile and a beneficial clinical effect in fluctuating patients with PD when given as an add-on to chronic levodopa therapy. Monitoring of liver or other safety parameters during entacapone treatment is not required. Ropinirole has beneficial adjuvant effects in parkinsonian patients with moderate motor disability and motor fluctuations. This is unlike the case with experimental animals. This study demonstrates that pergolide mesylate, as an adjunct to levodopa, is an effective antiparkinsonian agent that provides clinical improvement while permitting a reduction in levodopa dose. Treatment with pramipexole in doses up to 5 mg/day was safe and well tolerated by patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.Copyright Lippincott-Raven Publishers"

42,CD003054,"The usual care by family physicians was ineffective at modifying progressive metabolic deterioration in high-risk individuals. The lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin. Since modest weight loss significantly reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, further research is needed to determine how best to increase the percentage of subjects achieving at least a modest weight loss. We conclude that lifestyle intervention aimed at achieving ideal body weight in men with IGT is effective and can be conducted in an outpatient clinic setting. Diet and/or exercise interventions led to a significant decrease in the incidence of diabetes over a 6-year period among those with IGT. These findings complement the findings of the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study and the American Diabetes Prevention Study, both of which tested intensive interventions, by showing that pragmatic lifestyle interventions result in improvements in obesity and whole body insulin sensitivity in individuals with IGT, without change in other cardiovascular risk factors. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of high-risk subjects. Both LSM and MET significantly reduced the incidence of diabetes in Asian Indians with IGT; there was no added benefit from combining them."
43,CD001005,"The intervention did not influence spirometric variables. The results of this study suggest that educating patients in small groups is as effective as individual counselling in improving knowledge of asthma, is acceptable to patients and takes much less time. One year after the end of the school, we could find no differences between the two groups (school versus controls) with regard to the number of urgent care visits (9 vs 9), scheduled visits (22 vs 21) and hospital admissions (2 vs 2). The economic consequences of the implementation programme depend on the specific setup of the local healthcare system, where the programme is applied. A clinically significant proportion of asthmatic patients substantially underestimate disease severity and thereby may be at risk of increased mortality or morbidity. The paradoxical result whereby patients learnt more from the tape but preferred the book suggests that a distinction can be made between information that patients need, which may be acquired better from an audiocassette, and information that they want, which may be acquired better from a book. The medical status of the two groups did not change appreciably over the period of the study. Further studies of factors affecting attitudes, beliefs, and actions are needed to improve the advice and support given to asthma patients. Although the usefulness of the positive written appeal increased when employed by the asthmatic nurse, there were no substantive independent effects of the written message on emergency department use. Education enables patients with asthma to decrease utilization of emergency services."
44,CD006829,"This study supports the use of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 for the reduction of COPD exacerbations in patients with COPD. Budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (Symbicort) maintains the benefit of treatment optimisation, stabilising lung function and delaying exacerbations more effectively than either component drug alone or placebo. Both budesonide/formoterol pMDI dosages were well tolerated relative to formoterol and placebo. We conclude that FSC 250/50 decreases lung hyperinflation at rest and during exercise with an associated increase in exercise endurance time when compared with placebo. Because inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists and corticosteroid combination treatment produces better control of symptoms and lung function, with no greater risk of side-effects than that with use of either component alone, this combination treatment should be considered for patients with COPD. Both budesonide/formoterol pMDI dosage strengths were well tolerated relative to the monocomponents and placebo. We conclude that FSC improved lung function and reduced the severity of dyspnea compared with individual components and placebo. Treatment with FSC (FP, 250 microg, and SM, 50 microg) twice daily substantially improved morning lung function and sustained these improvements for over a period of 24 weeks compared with FP or SM treatment alone in patients with COPD, with no additional safety concerns for the combination treatment vs that with the individual components. SM&FP 50/250 microcg regularly assumed in combination via a single Diskus inhaler for a 52 week period improves respiratory function (such as FEV(1), morning PEF), and and symptom score significantly in moderate COPD previously treated with theophylline, and at an higher extent than SM alone or P. The use of beta(2) short acting prn is also reduced, together with the number of exacerbations. This study demonstrates that combination therapy with salmeterol/fluticasone compared with salmeterol monotherapy significantly reduces the frequency of moderate/severe exacerbations in patients with severe COPD. These data confirm the beneficial effect of FSC on the management of COPD exacerbations and support the use of FSC in patients with COPD. These results suggest a role for budesonide/formoterol in the long-term management of moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

46,CD007345,"Single-dose prophylaxis with piperacillin is not associated with a clinically significant reduction in the incidence of acute cholangitis after ERCP in patients suspected of having biliary tract stones or distal common bile duct stricture. These results suggest that bacteria could play a role in the pathogenesis of post-ERCP pancreatitis Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis are discussed. Our findings indicate that ERCP induce bacteremia in a small group of patients and suggest that prophylactic administration of clindamicine plus gentamicine does not reduce the incidence of bacteremia and cholangitis, and do not support the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to ERCP. We concluded that antimicrobial prophylaxis significantly reduces the incidence of septic complications after therapeutic ERCP among patients presenting with cholestasis. It is worth considering carrying out ERCP on an out-patient basis in special cases. Further studies are needed with higher dosages or antibiotic combinations to improve these results."

48,CD005203,"Extensively hydrolyzed formulas are safe and effective for most infants; an amino acid-derived formula may be preferable for infants with multiple food allergies, especially for the maintenance of normal growth. This response rate to the diet was not statistically significant. The study suggests that advice on the dietary exclusion of eggs is useful as part of the overall management of young children with atopic eczema and sensitivity to eggs. There was no correlation between a positive prick test to egg and cows' milk antigen and response to the trial diet. The results from the examination of this relatively small number of patients suggest that elementary intolerance plays little role in the etiology of atopic dermatitis in adults. Feeding an AA resulted in improved growth compared with feeding eHF, despite similar dietary intakes, and may therefore be considered as a beneficial alternative in infants with severe cow's milk allergy intolerance. This study failed to show benefit from a few foods diet. Maternal dietary exclusion seems to benefit some breast fed babies with eczema."
49,CD003978,"It is the purpose of this paper to discuss these differences and their significance. In addition, for most spatial parameters, the statistical significance varied considerably among the three methods used for the analysis of symmetry. Application of these results to the choice of prosthetic components is discussed. These results suggest that the intact lower extremity is susceptible to excessive floor impact, and that prosthetic foot design can have an effect on the magnitude of the vertical forces experienced by the limb. The Re-Flex VSP appears to have a positive effect on energy cost, efficiency, and relative exercise intensity compared with the other prosthetic foot types during walking and running. To improve the walking abilities of those persons with transtibial amputations, prosthetic foot designs need to incorporate mechanisms which promote early foot flat while preserving limb stability. Based on this pilot data, recommendations are made for future studies including appropriate sample size. These results seem to support the classification criteria of articulated and non-articulated prosthetic mechanisms. This increased rate was a function of the greater walking velocity employed by the traumatic subjects, made possible by their better physical fitness. During walking at comfortable speed with the Multiflex foot the ankle and hip range of motion averaged 2.1 and 3.1 degrees respectively, less than during walking with the Quantum foot. Results provide quantitative and qualitative information about the dynamic performance of the various feet, which can be helpful in prescribing the optimal prosthetic foot for individual amputees. The energy-storing foot should be reserved for active and fast walkers, whereas the SACH foot seems more suitable for elderly patients with amputation with a slow walk. The effective factor of the Flex-foot appears to be minimization of the center of gravity elevation, which was accomplished through a significant increase in terminal stance dorsiflexion compared to the other feet tested (p < .0001). Further studies with a larger sample size are suggested. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd. Because no energy savings resulted for the DER feet, the release of stored energy in the flexible feet may not occur at the proper time to assist in ambulation as a result of the natural frequency of oscillation. Via accelerometer measurement, it was found that the more compliant and lossy SACH foot heel was less likely to transmit high frequency vibration. Future prosthetic designs should provide TT amputees with improved ankle mobility that attempt to capture the dynamic characteristics of a normal articulation between the foot and shank segments during the early stance weight acceptance period. All investigated variations can be clearly characterized by the sagittal moments acting on the joints of the prosthetic limb during gait."

54,CD005059,"There were more complications in the control group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Patients undergoing aortic surgery under thoracic epidural anaesthesia can be extubated early, without markedly depressing peripheral reserves in oxygen extraction. Combined general and epidural anaesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia do not reduce the incidence of myocardial ischaemia or morbidity compared with general anaesthesia and postoperative intravenous analgesia. Epidural morphine-bupivacaine is associated with reduced early postoperative intravenous opioid requirements, more rapid tracheal extubation, and superior analgesia after abdominal aortic surgery, with comparable respiratory effects. Thus, the latter procedure seems to affect gastric function less than GA alone. In patients undergoing surgery of the abdominal aorta, thoracic epidural anesthesia combined with a light general anesthesia and followed by either intravenous or epidural patient-controlled analgesia, offers no major advantage or disadvantage when compared with general anesthesia alone followed by either intravenous or epidural patient-controlled analgesia. Combining epidural anaesthesia with general anaesthesia altered intraoperative cardiovascular management but did not affect postoperative outcome. Epidural anesthesia and epidural analgesia improve the overall outcome and shorten the intubation time and intensive care stay in patients undergoing abdominal aortic operations. We found no evidence that perioperative epidural analgesia significantly influences major morbidity or mortality after major abdominal surgery. We conclude that in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery, TEA has no apparent advantage over general anesthesia. The authors conclude that EAA exerted a significant beneficial effect on operative outcome in a group of high risk surgical patients. Post-operative hypertension and tachycardia as well as the increase in plasma noradrenaline are prevented by epidural administration of bupivacaine-fentanyl. Using Holter monitoring after aortic surgery, this study shows that the use of thoracic epidural analgesia with bupivacaine and fentanyl did not result in a lower incidence of myocardial ischemia compared with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine. Analgesic efficacy and side effects of epidural sufentanil and morphine were similar. The inflammatory cytokines appear to play a major role in this process."

58,CD004737,"The method of placental removal and not the position of the uterus at the time of its repair has a significant role in blood loss during cesarean birth. Manual removal of the placenta at cesarean delivery results in more operative blood loss and a higher incidence of postcesarean endometritis. Routine manual removal of placenta at cesarean section significantly increases perioperative blood loss and postpartum maternal infectious morbidity. There were no statistically significant differences in measures of postcesarean febrile morbidity based on placental delivery method or intraoperative glove change. Manual delivery of the placenta is not associated with a significantly greater risk of operative blood loss, decreased postoperative hemoglobin levels or increased incidence of endometritis compared with spontaneous placental separation. We conclude that spontaneous expulsion of the placenta at cesarean delivery results in less operative blood loss and a lower incidence of postoperative endometritis. The frequency of febrile morbidity in our study cases was considerably lower than heretofore reported. Spontaneous delivery of the placenta after cesarean delivery is associated with a decrease in the incidence of postcesarean infections. Intraoperative glove change does not decrease post-cesarean endometritis. No difference in postoperative complications was noted between the groups."

60,CD001487,"Corresponding rates for secondary patency at 6 years were 51.4% and 76.4% (p < 0.005). Dacron is the graft material of choice if the saphenous vein is not available. There was no difference in long-term graft performance between HUV and HBD for above knee infrainguinal bypass. During follow-up the incidence of PTFE failure was on the average 2.1 times higher than that of umbilical vein failure (95% confidence limits 1.2 to 3.4). The use of polytetrafluoroethylene above the knee is a reasonable alternative in femoropopliteal bypass grafting that is associated with acceptable short-term patency rates. PTFE and Dacron are equally suitable for femoro-popliteal bypass. Use of SV, however, leads to fewer occlusions and repeat operations. This trial confirms that Dacron is at least as durable as PTFE for above-knee bypass procedures, and might even be superior. The incidence of major limb amputation, however, was significantly greater (P < .025) in the PTFE group compared with the HBD group at both 3 and 5 years of follow-up.

61,CD008449,"The results indicate that mirror therapy effectively reduces pain and enhances upper limb motor function in stroke patients with upper limb CRPSt1. In light of the evidence, it remains to be seen whether mental practice with motor imagery is a valid rehabilitation technique in its own right. In our group of subacute stroke patients, hand functioning improved more after mirror therapy in addition to a conventional rehabilitation program compared with a control treatment immediately after 4 weeks of treatment and at the 6-month follow-up, whereas mirror therapy did not affect spasticity. Future research has to determine the optimum practice intensity and duration for improvements to persist and generalize to other functional domains. Therefore, a hand rehabilitation strategy combined with NMES and mirror therapy may be more helpful for improving hand function in stroke patients than NMES or mirror therapy only. MT stimulated recovery from hemineglect. . MT early after stroke is a promising method to improve sensory and attentional deficits and to support motor recovery in a distal plegic limb.

64,CD001162,"However, Sulpiride appeared more beneficial following the review during the 8th week and the 4th week. There was an association between plasma sulpiride levels and therapeutic response after four weeks' treatment. Efficacy of both compounds was less marked in chronic forms of schizophrenia. By comparing the dose-response curves of four drugs tested in the same fashion, haloperidol and sulpiride were superior to propericiazine and timiperone because they displayed a wider dose range for the maintenance treatment of remitted schizophrenic outpatients. Bromperidol and sulpiride are concluded to have different clinical profile in the treatment of schizophrenic hospitalized patients. The effect of the two preparations was very similar as were the type and frequency of side effects, except that sulpiride did not cause sunrash.

65,CD008862,"These results confirm that real rTMS over motor cortex can enhance and maintain recovery and may be a useful add on therapy in treatment of acute stroke patients. Patients showed a significant decrease in simple and choice reaction time and improved performance of the Purdue Pegboard test with their affected hand after rTMS of the motor cortex in the intact hemisphere as compared with sham rTMS. The effectiveness of TMS treatment depends on the age of the patients and timing of beginning treatment. Furthermore, this increased dose of rTMS is not associated with cognitive adverse effects and/or epileptogenic activity. A positive trend for motor-evoked potential frequency was found for Real-rTMS + RealVMC, whereas a negative trend for motor-evoked potential frequency was found for Placebo-rTMS + PlaceboVMC. Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that rTMS may be an effective and safe treatment alternative for patients with refractory depression and stroke. rTMS enhances the effect of task-oriented training in those with chronic stroke, especially by increasing gait spatial symmetry and corticomotor excitability symmetry. These improvement in the motor function lasted for one week after rTMS and motor training (p < 0.001).Conclusion: rTMS improved the motor learning of the affected hand in patients after stroke; thus, it can apply as anew rehabilitation strategy for patients after stroke. Classification of evidence: This interventional study provides Class I evidence that time-locked rTMS before or after physical therapy improves measures of dexterity and force in the affected limb in patients with chronic deficits more than 6 months poststroke. Disability scales measured before rTMS, at the end of the last rTMS session, and 10 days later showed that real rTMS improved patients' scores more than sham. Although this study provided further evidence that even relatively brief sessions of CIT can have a substantial effect, it provided no support for adjuvant use of rTMS. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that left posterior parietal cortex theta-burst stimulation improves hemispatial neglect for up to 2 weeks after treatment.

66,CD004929,"These data support that nasogastric decompression is not necessary following elective colorectal surgery for malignant and premalignant lesions. No significant difference could be seen in the tubed or no-tube group. The authors conclude that routine nasogastric decompression is not warranted after elective surgery involving small- or large-bowel anastomosis. Routine nasogastric decompression is not necessary in elective operations for gastric cancer. The surgical dogma of the need to have an NGT in longer for blunt trauma was not revealed in this study, however, a larger study would be needed to determine this with significance. We conclude that such a routine is not justified and should be reserved for those patients developing specific complications. Therefore, it is more beneficial to the recovery of patients without undergoing gastrointestinal decompression. We conclude that in elective colon operations, the routine use of postoperative nasogastric decompression is unnecessary and can safely be omitted. Cimetidine lowered nasogastric output on the first postoperative day (p less than 0.05), but did not prevent vomiting. Early feeding is feasible and well tolerated and is associated with reduced postoperative discomfort and a more rapid recovery in patients undergoing major surgery for gynecologic malignancies. We conclude that even though there is an increase in the rate of minor symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention, routine nasgastric decompression is not warranted after elective colon and rectal surgery. These strategies of early removing gastrointestinal decompression and early oral feeding in the patients undergoing colorectostomy are feasible and safe and associated with reduced postoperative discomfort and can accelerate the return of bowel function and improve rehabilitation. However, these findings suggest that NGT maintenance increases the risk of respiratory complications and the length of hospital stay. We suggest that NG tubes should be used according to the specific problems of each patient. Tube decompression should be used only in patients with paralytic ileus. (c) 2007 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Routine postoperative nasogastric decompression is unnecessary after radical gastrectomy even in the presence of gastric outlet obstruction. Routine placement of an NJT after Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy is unnecessary in elective total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. In conclusion, the routine postoperative use of nasogastric tubes for abdominal aortic procedures is unnecessary. As a result of this study, we have eliminated postoperative nasogastric decompression except in highly selected circumstances, such as extensive bowel surgery in patients with prior irradiation or substantial edema from bowel obstruction. Routine prophylactic postoperative nasogastric decompression is unnecessary after elective gastrectomy. Routine nasogastric aspiration after gastric or intestinal resection does not confer significant advantages to outweigh its discomfort and potential morbidity for patients and should be replaced by selective intubation when required postoperatively. These data seem to indicate that the routine prophylactic use of a nasogastric tube is unnecessary in gastrointestinal operations. The routine application of NGT in elective abdominal surgery could be omitted if the surgeon and nursing team are willing to renounce a useful tool in providing informations about the resolution of postoperative intestinal atony to the patient's benefit: in fact a severe discomfort due to the NGT was recorded in the 70% of our series. These results suggest that gastric cancer surgery can be performed safely without nasogastric decompression. This study has objectively demonstrated that early oral feeding is feasible and safe in patients who have elective colorectal surgery. Furthermore, we continue to support avoidance of routine prophylactic postoperative nasogastric decompression in uncomplicated, elective abdominal colorectal surgery. These data support selective use of NGD in general surgical patients and routine use of NGD for patients having major retroperitoneal or vascular procedures."
67,CD001878,"The result supports the hypothesis of a cervical mechanism causing post-traumatic headache and suggests that post-traumatic dizziness, visual disturbances and ear symptoms could be part of a cervical syndrome. It is concluded that either acupuncture therapy or physiotherapy relieves pain in tension-neck and headache patients. It is recommended that RTB remain the nonmedical treatment of choice for migraine, and that PT may be a useful adjunct for patients who fail to improve after such treatment. This appears to be important to manipulative therapists who appear to practise without the benefit of valid predictors of response to therapy. Manipulation also produced a significant increase in measured rotation that was maintained for three weeks and an immediate improvement in lateral flexion that was not maintained.This is to our knowledge the first published formal trial of such manipulation and should increase interest in this form of treatment by the medical profession. Manipulative therapy and exercise can reduce the symptoms of cervicogenic headache, and the effects are maintained. It appears probable that chiropractic care has an effect on the physical conditions related to stress and that in these people the effects of the migraine are reduced. It should be considered as an alternative to the chronic usage of analgesics. Repeated measure analysis of variance indicated that grouping variables of Biofeedback treatment, symptoms being evidenced less than 2 years and receiving over 15 treatment sessions best predicted successful intervention. As an isolated intervention, spinal manipulation does not seem to have a positive effect on episodic tension-type headache. Study results indicated that TT may have potential beyond a placebo effect in the treatment of tension headache pain. The improvement of headache intensity persisted unchanged 7-12 months after treatment. Spinal manipulation seemed to be as effective as a well-established and efficacious treatment (amitriptyline), and on the basis of a benign side effects profile, it should be considered a treatment option for patients with frequent migraine headaches. Large controlled studies should be performed to determine whether this intervention is actually effective. In conclusion, exposure of the inner thighs to pulsing electromagnetic fields for at least 3 weeks is an effective, short-term intervention for migraine, but not tension headaches. There is a need to assess the effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy beyond four weeks and to compare spinal manipulative therapy to an appropriate placebo such as sham manipulation in future clinical trials. Spinal manipulation has a significant positive effect in cases of cervicogenic headache."
68,CD006469,"Two patients remain in complete remission for 14+ and 17+ months. Since the control of advanced cervical carcinoma remains difficult, a combined modality approach with radiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy for stages IIB and III appears worth of trial. Because of its antitumor activity and its toxicologic advantage, a future role for CBDCA in the treatment of cervical cancer appears likely. In addition, the higher dose regimen was associated with greater myelosuppression and nephrotoxicity. It is of note that patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were those who responded best to this treatment, although the treatment is worthy of consideration for advanced squamous carcinoma in other areas. Hexamethylmelamine had a greater frequency of severe toxicity (50%, 10/20) than Adriamycin (10.5%, 2/19) (p = 0.014) and Cytoxan (10%, 2/10) (p = 0.014). CIFX improved the response rate and PFS duration in advanced cervix cancer compared with cisplatin alone, but at the cost of greater toxicity and with no improvement in survival. Combined with QOL results, the significant increase in response and PFS in the CP arm and the higher drop-out rate in the C arm suggest a better outcome for the combination regimen despite its increased myelosuppression. Although active against cervical carcinoma, these regimens have limited therapeutic value at this advanced stage of the disease. Response rates were similar for both agents (15% for carboplatin, 11% for iproplatin) and appear to be inferior to those noted with the parent compound, cisplatin. Thus, the addition of bleomycin in the dose-schedule employed to cisplatin and ifosfamide did not improve outcome in patients with advanced cervical cancer. Neither trimetrexate nor didemnin B at these doses and schedules is recommended for the treatment of advanced squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. This report describes the FDA's review supporting this first approval of a chemotherapeutic drug for advanced cervical cancer based on demonstration of a survival benefit. Nevertheless, QOL, as measured by these instruments, was not substantially impaired by this regimen. Neither of these regimens was predictably useful in our patient population. Copyright (c) 2005 S.

69,CD005944,"Prophylactic administration of mega doses of Vitamin A to the mother soon after delivery and to the infant at six months do not have any beneficial impact on the incidence of diarrhea and ARI in infancy. Postpartum maternal or neonatal vitamin A supplementation may not reduce infant mortality in infants of HIV-negative women with an apparently adequate vitamin A status. Postpartum Vitamin A supplementation had a beneficial impact on the infant serum retional and the breast milk retinol level but no effect on infant growth. The stability of vitamin A capsules merits further investigation. We conclude that while both interventions were beneficial, neither was sufficient to correct the underlying subclinical vitamin A deficiency in these women nor to bring their infants into adequate vitamin A status. Vitamin A supplementation of malnourished mothers maintains higher breastmilk retinol concentration for at least six months and reduces the duration of respiratory tract infection and febrile illness in their breastfed infants. We found no evidence that vitamin A supplementation affects infants' antibody responses to tetanus toxoid or oral polio vaccine delivered at EPI contacts. Caution is urged for future studies because trials have shown possible adverse effects of higher doses of vitamin A, and potential negative interactions with the expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) vaccines. There is a need for a better understanding of factors affecting absorption and metabolism of vitamin A. High dose vitamin A supplementation of lactating mothers is an efficacious way to improve the vitamin A status of both mother and breast-fed infant."

73,CD000305,"Fragmin given once daily offers an effective and safe thromboprophylaxis in hip fracture surgery. The heparin regime was safe; operative blood loss was not increased, nor was there an increased incidence of wound complications as compared to the placebo group. Bleeding and transfusions were the same in the three groups. Low-dose heparin reduced the overall frequency of venous thrombosis and its extent as judged by the frequency of bilaterally abnormal scans, but this reduction did not achieve statistical significance. Pneumatic leg compression devices are effective in reducing the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients with hip fractures. Therefore the ultrasound examination is an unsuitable screening method to detect deep vein thrombosis in patients with fractures of the proximal end of the femur. The heparin was commenced on admission to hospital and it is suggested that in this group of patients low dosage heparin prophylaxis should start on admission and not wait until surgery. The A-V Impulse System appears to be a safe and effective method of reducing the incidence of proximal deep-vein thrombosis, and of postoperative swelling. Our findings suggest that, in patients with hip fracture, LMWH is not useful at the dosage used. A "flexible" schedule of administration is proposed on the basis of the results of plasma anti-Xa assays. The technique allows the operation to be carried out without the problems produced by low dose heparins and mobilisation is not hindered by compression garments. Mortality within 1 month of operation was unaffected by the type of prophylaxis. Of the twenty-three placebo-treated patients with fracturs, 39.1 per cent had a thromboembolic event, while 41.4 per cent of the twenty-nine who received heparin showed evidence of thromboembolism, demonstrating that low-dose heparin afforded no protection, nor did it affect the incidence of bleeding complications or transfusion requirements in fracture patients. This difference is statistically significant (p less than 0.05). This trial suggests that a total daily dose of 40 mg of Enoxaparin can be effective in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in elderly surgically treated patients and does not involve a major risk of bleeding. LMWH may thus be effective in preventing thigh DVTs and pulmonary emboli. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel any further in this group of patients. In most instances, adjustment resulted in increased heparin dosage but this was not associated with any evidence of excessive bleeding. This showed that the 0-hypothesis could not be rejected, and that consequently no difference in the frequency of deep-vein thrombosis was detected.

74,CD000567,"Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society The 7.5% NaCl/dextran 70 solution appears particularly promising for treatment of injured patients in the field. We conclude that Pentastarch is safe and effective for the initial resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock. Use of albumin and 5% dextrose in water in the postoperative period seemed to produce less deviations from control values of most measured variables, than the other two groups. We concluded that intraoperative fluid resuscitation with colloid, when compared with crystalloid administration, is associated with an improvement in the quality of postoperative recovery. The addition of colloid to crystalloid resuscitation fluids produces no long lasting benefit on total body blood flow, and promotes accumulation of lung water when edema fluid is being reabsorbed from the burn wound. Study registration: ISRCTN 42061860. We concluded that PS is a safe, efficient method for inducing hemodynamic recovery of hypovolemic trauma patients, with a clear reduction in the intravenous volumes required for acute resuscitation. Furthermore, using both cardiac output and PWP as a guide to fluid resuscitation of our patients, we found that the type of fluid (crystalloid or colloid) for resuscitation did not influence the course of respiratory distress in these patients up to three days following resuscitation. Thus, these results cannot confirm the hypothesis that crystalloid fluids per se cause hypercoagulability in vivo. When evaluated for overall survival rate, hypertonic infusion benefited significantly only patients with MAP < 70 mmHg (p < .01). Thus, manipulation of COP by PL was unnecessary in these patients. Infusion of 250 ml hypertonic saline solution in patients with severe hypovolemia was not related to any complications, nor did it affect mortality rates; it improved MAP significantly, acutely expanded plasma volume by 24%, and reduced significantly the volumes of crystalloids and blood required in their resuscitation. Normal saline upto 110 mL/kg, and gelatin polymer solution upto 70 mL/kg may be required in first hour for successful fluid resuscitation of septic shock in children. The addition of a colloid, in the form of 6% dextran 70, did not offer any additional benefit, at least in this setting of rapid urban transport. The albumin supply, however, did not influence the final outcome of the patients under these circumstances because it treated only a characteristic symptom and not the cause of the disease. 7.5%HS and 6%HES 130/0.4 could improve the effect of early fluid resuscitation on severe sepsis, and it could lower the incidence of MODS. We hypothesize that this is most likely due to an improved microcirculation with reduced endothelial activation and less endothelial damage. Thus, in the initial treatment of traumatic-haemorrhagic shock and in the post-resuscitative period dextran 70 would seem of advantage over Ringer's acetate both in shortening the shock period and in reducing the frequency of adult respiratory distress syndrome. Improved microcirculation may be the mechanism for the better ptiO(2) in the HES group. When titrated to physiological end points, even large volumes of balanced salt solutions are tolerated well. ). fluid and decreased cumulative fluid balance, after HSD infusion the patients had increased filling pressures of the heart with improved cardiac output. Treatment with 5 percent albumin from Day 0 to Day 14 does not decrease the burden of MODS in adult burn patients. Both type of fluids did not show the effect on coagulability of the septic patients, but colloid fluid resuscitation may protect the vascular endothelial cell, reduce the inhibition of fibrinolytic system, and alleviate hypercoagulability state of patients in early stage. There was high correlation (r = 0.951) between measured COP and values calculated from TPRI in patients receiving hypertonic fluid, colloid containing hypertonic fluid, or no fluid:COP = 4.08 (TPRI)--4.61. Methods to improve recruitment are required to enhance the feasibility of conducting a multicentre fluid resuscitation trial in early septic shock. Clinical Trial Registration: Clinical Trials.gov, NCT00316017. The authors conclude that fluid resuscitation of circulatory shock with colloid solutions increases COP and requires less volume of resuscitative fluid. Sternal of peripheral vein infusion of 250 ml of 7.5% NaCl/6% dextran 60 is an effective initial treatment of hemorrhagic shock. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT00464204. In a setting of limited volume resuscitation, the solutions are likely to have a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio. ). Thus, cardiac surgical patients receiving colloids exhibited reduced fluid requirements, superior hemodynamic performance, and shortened intensive care stay when compared with those given crystalloid resuscitation. Colloid fluid loading leads to a greater increase in preload-recruitable cardiac and left ventricular stroke work indices than that with saline, because of greater plasma volume expansion following an increase in plasma COP. HES 130/0.4 caused a similar degree and duration of coagulation impairment as observed when only crystalloid was given. Our results so far have failed to justify routine administration of concentrated albumin postoperatively. No clinically important differences in haemodynamic or lung function variables were found between the groups. Expansion of the ECFV in excess of the volume of 5% albumin infused suggests that fluid may move from the intracellular fluid volume to the ECFV in septic patients who receive this fluid. In patients with traumatic or neurogenic shock due to acute volume deficiency, there was significantly better hemodynamic improvement, judged by CVP and PAOP measurements using the modified fluid gelatin for volume replacement than with lactated Ringer's solution during the first hour of resuscitation. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) In conclusion, postoperative fluid substitution with dextran has no advantages over crystalloids only, with regard to granulation tissue formation if postoperative fluid support is optimum, according to PscO2 measurements. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The potential impact of this solution on medical care and the results of this feasibility study justify the initiation of a larger prospective, randomized clinical trial on the efficacy of this solution in the prehospital setting. We conclude that volume therapy with Haemaccel following heart surgery requires less volume and achieves better filling of the circulation compared to Ringer's solution. 3% HES 200/0.5 solution can be considered as an effective volume substitute with short intravascular retention time, which seems to be of advantage in patients coming off extracorporeal circulation. A diluted colloid solution in Ringer's lactate is of significant value in maintaining intravascular volumes and hemodynamics during and after major operative procedures.

Inhibition of platelet aggregation by certain colloids may provide additional protection against the increased thrombotic risk in patients following major surgery. In patients undergoing major surgery, volume resuscitation with medium molecular weight HES improves the splanchnic blood flow and tissue oxygenation. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Pulmonary shunting and expansion of the extracellular fluid volume may be minimized without adverse effects on renal function by administration of fluids rich in albumin in preference to sodium. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) A titrated dose and a low rate of infusion may substantially improve the safety. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Further large-scale studies, stratified for admission pulse pressure, are indicated. No clinical advantage was found for either solution in this study. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) No side-effect attributable to the use of saline solution was observed. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings before definitive treatment recommendations can be made. We conclude that in patients without postoperative increases in WP, ETVL changes minimally during CPB and is not influenced by the type of fluid administered as the primary volume replacement in the postoperative period. Furthermore, no obligatory contraction or expansion of ECV occurred after major elective surgery. Fluid resuscitation with HES in the early stages of SAP can decrease the risk of intra-abdominal hypertension and reduce the use of mechanical ventilation. We conclude that hemodynamic stability occurred faster with dextran, and ventilatory weaning was somewhat easier with crystalloid. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

75,CD007394,"A repeated negative result is a strong argument against the diagnosis of IA; however, an awareness of the possibility of unexplained false negative results is important. In conclusion, both PCR and ELISA techniques should be used in unison to aid the detection of invasive fungal infections. In conclusion, BG and GM detection are useful tests for the diagnosis of IA in high-risk hematological patients, but a combination of the two tests was very useful to identify false-positive reactions by each test. According to our data, prospective studies in well defined pediatric patients are urgently needed to determine the value of serial Aspergillus PCR assays for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in children at risk. If either GM-EIA or NASBA results suggest IA, the diagnostic yield for IA could be improved, and NASBA could be a useful marker for predicting the clinical course and outcome of treatment. Patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may transiently have a positive test in the early post-transplant period. Physicians should be aware of the possible interference of treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam when interpreting the results of the GM assay. These results favour the use of EIA for early diagnosis and monitoring of aspergillosis in BMT patients, although the predictive value of transient positivity remains to be ascertained. In conclusion, detection of galactomannan by the Platelia Aspergillus test allows for a specific and relatively sensitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in hematological patients with a high and intermediate risk for invasive aspergillosis. Based on these findings, aggressive antifungal therapy should be initiated. Nevertheless, the GM ELISA appears useful to assess IA and to follow the efficacy of antifungal treatment. The 0.5 cutoff may allow for better performance as an early diagnostic test. In patients at high risk for IA, positive results for Aspergillus by PCR of blood samples are highly suggestive for IA and contribute to the diagnosis. These results encourage further evaluation of the Platelia Aspergillus test, to assess its role in the management of invasive aspergillosis in BMT patients. These results indicate that, when CT is used systematically and at an early stage, GM detection in CT-based BAL fluid has a high PPV for diagnosing IPA early in untreated patients. Together, these noninvasive tests should improve the diagnosis of IA. The PCR method seems to be more specific, and a combination of the two should improve the diagnosis of IA. Once accepted galactomannan test as a diagnostic criterium for invasive aspergillosis knowing potential causes of false positive results is of paramount importance. In conclusion, among these weekly screening tests for IA, the double-sandwich ELISA test was the most sensitive at predicting the diagnosis of IA in high-risk patients with hematological disorders, using a reduced cutoff of 0.6 O.D.I. The GM EIA is a useful diagnostic toolfor the diagnosis and monitoring of the course oflA in the presented institute. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. A new cutoff value for the ELISA of 0.700 is proposed for non-allo-HSCT adults. The disappointing sensitivity associated with the presence of rare false-positive cases underlines the limits of this test. In addition to serial screening for GM antigenemia and radiological surveillance, PCR-ELISA may improve the rates of early diagnosis of IA and the management of patients with hematological malignancies. However, further evaluation in prospective studies is required. The test is troubled by a low sensitivity and high frequency of false-negative tests. A better understanding of the kinetics of the GM in different clinical situations is necessary to maximize the benefit of the test in Aspergillus surveillance. These findings have direct implications for preventive strategies, because the diagnostic utility of the antigen assay is compromised during receipt of prophylactic or empirical antifungal therapies. Further evaluation of PCR assays for the diagnosis of IA and other invasive fungal infections is warranted. It is therefore unsuitable for screening of asymptomatic patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis, but does have a useful role in confirming the diagnosis in symptomatic patients. Prospective screening for GM allows earlier diagnosis of aspergillosis than do conventional diagnostic criteria. A cutoff OD index of 0.5--identical to the approved cutoff in the United States--improves the overall performance of the PA-EIA for adult hematology patients. However, the clinical benefit of lower cut-offs (particularly for earlier diagnosis) depends upon the kinetics of antigenaemia and the intensity of serum sampling. Regular monitoring of the kinetics of GM-EIA indices is a useful predictor of clinical course and outcome. Galactomannan detection in serum could be useful for an early diagnosis of IA in OLT recipients. Although the ELISA test did not appear to play a role in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and in the anticipation of antifungal therapy in our experience, it clarifies the diagnosis of infection in probable or possible invasive aspergillosis especially when the cutoff value is lowered and is useful for monitoring patients receiving specific therapy. In the clinical setting, the decision to administer mold-active treatment should based on detection of new pulmonary infiltrates on CT performed early during infection, rather than on results of EIA for detection of GM. Although the ELISA test did not have any role in the anticipation of the diagnosis, it clarifies the diagnosis of IA in allo-HSCT."

78,CD004787,"Our results do not support the use of this method of chemoembolization in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, TAE has a marked antitumoral effect associated to a slower growth of the tumor, but it does not improve the survival of patients with nonsurgical HCC. TAE has a limited use in suppressing local recurrence when performed before PEIT but not before RFA. In our randomized study, lipiodol chemoembolization did not improve the survival of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with tamoxifen. Postoperative TACE combined with PVC may benefit the survival of patients with HCC complicated by PVTT in the short-term (less than 60 months), but long-term efficacy is not yet certain and needs to be confirmed by further studies. In a group of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma but without severe liver disease, lipiodol chemoembolization reduced tumor growth, often caused acute liver failure, and did not significantly improve survival. Preoperative TACE regimens may enhance apoptosis of HCC cells by up-regulating the expression of Bax protein and down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2 protein and ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax protein expression. In conclusion, this study suggests that TACE improves neither the survival nor the quality of life in patients with HCC and cirrhosis. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates were 38.9%, 0%, 0%, and 0% for the patients who underwent palliative resection only, and were 68.3%, 32.3%, 21.5%, and 21.5% respectively for the patients undergoing TACE 3-4 weeks after palliative hepatectomy (P < 0.001). Chemoembolisation improved survival of stringently selected patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Postoperative TACE plus Talpha(1) treatment for HCC patients does not decrease the recurrence rate but may delay its occurrence and prolong surviving time. In conclusion, in Asian patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, transarterial Lipiodol chemoembolization significantly improves survival and is an effective form of treatment."

81,CD003772,"There was a tendency for those not cured by single dose treatment to relapse whereas those treated by conventional therapy tended to be reinfected. Abnormal laboratory findings appeared in 6 cases (2 with eosinophilia, 2 with increased GOT and 2 with increased GPT) in the suppository group and 7 cases (2 with eosinophilia, 2 with thrombocytosis, 2 with increased GOT and 1 with increased GPT) in the oral form group. With age-appropriate dosing and measurement of serum trough concentrations before the second dose, OD gentamicin is safe and effective for the treatment of UTI requiring parenteral treatment in children aged 1 month to 12 years. Rates of cures and recurrence in the compared groups were not statistically different (P greater than 0.05). The addition of a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone to a 10-day course of oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for urinary tract infection with fever resulted in no difference at 48 hours in the urine sterilization rate, degree of clinical improvement, or subsequent hospital admission rate. A total of 3 weeks of intravenous and oral antibiotic therapy tailored to the pathogen noted in cultures should be the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with ALN. Clinical Trials NCT00161330 [ClinicalTrials.gov]. Once-daily injection of ceftriaxone in children is also an attractive advantage of the drug when compared to twice-daily cefotaxime. Use of cefixime will result in substantial reductions of health care expenditures. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) It is concluded that cefetamet pivoxil in the standard twice-daily dose of 10 mg/kg was equally effective and as well tolerated as 20 mg/kg cefetamet pivoxil given twice daily or 30-50 mg/kg amoxycillin/clavulanic acid given three times daily. The use of oral therapy may result in a significant reduction of health care expenditure. Isepamicin was shown to be as effective and safe as amikacin in the treatment of children with pyelonephritis and might prove an advantageous alternative in areas with high incidence of resistance to other aminoglycosides. In children with acute pyelonephritis, initial intravenous treatment for 10 days, compared with three days, does not significantly reduce the development of renal scarring. However, this new approach needs to be confirmed in other studies. 10-day treatment may not be sufficient to prevent early recurrence of pyelonephritic infections in infants under 6 months of age. Cefepime and ceftazidime are equally safe and efficacious treatment for pyelonephritis in pediatric patients.

84,CD002095,"was shown to be effective and safe for the short-term treatment of daytime and nighttime heartburn and for other symptoms associated with mild-moderate GERD. Rabeprazole provides fast and potent relief from heartburn and other symptoms of nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease. Omeprazole 20 mg once daily was highly effective in relieving heartburn whereas cisapride 20 mg twice daily was not significantly more effective than placebo. Omeprazole, 20 and 10 mg once daily, provides rapid relief of heartburn in patients without endoscopic oesophagitis. Pantoprazole is significantly superior to ranitidine in the treatment of key and associated gastrointestinal symptoms of GERD and is well tolerated. This study suggests that esomeprazole is efficacious in treating Chinese patients with non-erosive reflux disease. Low-dose pantoprazole is an effective alternative to standard-dose ranitidine for initial and maintenance treatment of patients with symptomatic GORD. An empiric 'proton pump inhibitor-start' strategy relieves heartburn more effectively than an 'H2-receptor antagonist-start' strategy up to 12 weeks but has no effect on subsequent relapse, which is rapid in most patients. Omeprazole 20 or 10 mg once daily is significantly more effective than cisapride in the resolution of heartburn, regardless of the presence of erosive oesophagitis, and this is accompanied by an improvement in patient quality of life. It is concluded that placebo suspension has a considerable effect on gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms, but cimetidine suspension provides significantly better relief. Both famotidine regimens resulted in a significantly greater proportion of patients with complete endoscopic healing than placebo, with the BID dosing being numerically superior to the 40-mg HS dose. Once-daily esomeprazole 40 mg dosing is recommended as no advantage was gained by splitting the dose. Determination of the symptomatic response to 40 mg of omeprazole for 14 days is a simple and inexpensive tool for the diagnosis of GERD, with a sensitivity and specificity comparable to 24-h pH monitoring. The results of this double blind trial indicate that cimetidine is more effective than the placebo for the relief of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. Treatment was well tolerated. Esomeprazole, at daily doses of 40 mg or 20 mg, is effective and safe for the treatment of chronic heartburn in patients without erosive oesophagitis. We conclude that, in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, ranitidine therapy, 150 mg twice daily, markedly reduced the heartburn symptoms of reflux disease and significantly improved the endoscopic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Omeprazole is more effective than famotidine for the control of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms in H. pylori-negative patients, while similar efficacy is observed in H. pylori-positive patients with non-erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Omeprazole, 20 mg, is the most effective initial therapy for relief of GORD symptoms. It reduces the frequency and severity of symptoms within the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment and diminishes the use of nonprescription antacids while improving the quality of life as measured by both a general health status instrument and a disease-specific instrument. It is simple and applicable in general practice, where most patients are seen. After cessation of treatment, symptomatic relapse was rapid and frequent in both endoscopy-positive and endoscopy-negative patients. Omeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg once daily is effective and well tolerated in patients with NERD regardless of their endoscopic classification. In both treatment periods, metoclopramide-treated patients had significantly more symptomatic improvement than the control group (P less than 0.05). We conclude that omeprazole is superior to cimetidine for the relief of all grades of heartburn in GERD, whether or not the patient has unequivocal endoscopic oesophagitis. Omeprazole 20 mg once daily is effective in providing relief of the symptoms typical of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in patients with essentially normal oesophageal mucosa. It cannot be expected that mechanical problems in the hiatal region will be influenced by ranitidine, which is probably why half the patients did not respond. Lansoprazole therapy is more effective than standard dosages of ranitidine or placebo in relieving symptoms in patients with endoscopically confirmed non-erosive reflux esophagitis. Omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, was superior to omeprazole, 10 mg once daily, and to placebo in providing early and sustained resolution of heartburn, as well as treatment of other troublesome GERD symptoms. The relapse rate was high after treatment stopped."

86,CD004943,"The findings suggest that as a means of prophylaxis for Mendelson's syndrome in patients undergoing elective Caesarean section, magnesium trisilicate mixture BPC 20 ml is more effective than a single oral dose of cimetidine 400 mg, administered in the manner described. dose of tramadol is useful pre-treatment to minimize the risk of acid aspiration during operation, and in improving pain relief during 24 h after surgery. When gastric pH and volume were considered together, the groups of patients who received cimetidine were found to be closest to the defined "safe limits", of pH greater than 2.5 and volume less than 25 ml. We conclude that 50 mg of intravenous ranitidine given at the time of decision to proceed to cesarean section reduces the risk of acid aspiration provided that at least 30 min have elapsed from injection to induction of anesthesia. While omeprazole is useful as prophylaxis against pulmonary aspiration during general anaesthesia for elective Caesarean section, the addition of a prokinetic agent seems to be necessary to maximise its effects. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) We conclude that sodium citrate effectively increases gastric pH when given less than 60 min prior to the induction of anesthesia. Percentages of patients with pH2 less than or equal to 2.5 in groups 1, 2 and 3 were 50, 10.3 and 1.6, respectively. We conclude that omeprazole 40 mg iv administered at the time of the decision to operate, results in higher gastric pH than ranitidine in obstetric patients undergoing emergency Caesarean section. This study reconfirms the high gastric volumes in pregnant patients with the need for preventative measures against aspiration during the induction of anaesthesia. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Application of intramuscularly cimetidine seems to be an effective method for prophylaxis of aspiration pneumonia in obstetric anesthesia. Hence this study showed that omeprazole was more effective and consistent than ranitidine at maintaining gastric pH greater than 3.5.

Single dose of ranitidine or famotidine administered orally three hours before surgery provided a more effective means to control and neutralize gastric secretion than omeprazole in parturients."

94,CD004888,"Conclusion: In patients with HIV, HCV therapy with PEG 2b or PEG 2a plus RBV had no significant differences in efficacy and safety. Coprescription of ribavirin and stavudine has no short-term impact on plasma HIV RNA level in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients treated with stavudine as a part of their antiretroviral treatment; this coprescription can be safely used, although an in vivo interaction between ribavirin and stavudine is possible. In conclusion, SVR was achieved in 19% of HIV/HCV coinfected subjects treated with daily IFN plus RBV, but the effectiveness of therapy was substantially diminished by relatively high rates of treatment-related toxicity. EVR assessment at week 8 may become a useful stategy in the management of therapy. Frequent monitoring of virological response may be very helpful to optimize treatment compliance, to tailor treatment duration and to minimize side effects. PEG-INF + RBV was significantly more effective than INF + RBV for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV co-infected patients, mainly of genotype 1 or 4. Eligibility for the study was unexpectedly low. In combination with ribavirin, treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is more effective than standard interferon alfa-2b for HCV infection in HIV-infected patients. Since HCV-related liver disease is currently one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients, new treatment options are urgently needed for coinfected individuals.

Results of this study are limited by a small number of patients in each group and a fixed dose of MMC. Double-plate Molteno implantation more frequently affords IOP control than single-plate Molteno implantation; however, double plates are associated with greater risks of choroidal hemorrhages and/or effusions, corneal decompensation, flat anterior chambers, and phthisis bulbi. Because the ridge effect is unpredictable, further modifications are necessary to prevent postoperative hypotony. This study suggests that HAD implantation is an effective method in the management of refractory glaucoma in spite of its unneligible complications and combined with MMC can improve the prognosis."

Although the results were not statistically significant in the group of women with intramural and intramural-subserosal fibroids, this study confirms the important role of the position of the uterine fibroid in infertility as well as the importance of fibroids removal before the achievement of a pregnancy, to improve both the chances of fertilization and pregnancy maintenance."
102,CD005006,"Myocet improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by significantly reducing cardiotoxicity and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination with cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy for MBC. Epi given weekly at low doses preserves efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer, and given at equimolar doses, has a slightly better therapeutic index than the parent compound. Epirubicin appears to be an effective drug for the treatment of breast cancer and, given at equal doses, is less toxic than doxorubicin. Myocet appears to be an acceptable alternative to epirubicin as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer because it combines the dose-effect reliability of doxorubicin with the level of safety provided by epirubicin. These results indicate that epirubicin in a combination chemotherapy regimen is as active as doxorubicin and is significantly less toxic. Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society."
103,CD005397,"Exercise was found to be a better treatment choice than medication and may be preferable for patients with persistent or chronic vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation delivered by nurses in general practice improves symptoms, postural stability, and dizziness-related handicap in patients with chronic dizziness. Self-management booklets offer an inexpensive and easily disseminated means of helping people with Ménière disease to cope with dizziness symptoms. Comparison of our two study groups did not show any significant difference, revealing that both forms of therapy are effective. For many patients a simple home program of vestibular habituation head movement exercises is related to reduction in symptoms and increasing independence in activities of daily living. Customized exercise programs are beneficial in treatment of chronic unilateral vestibular dysfunction. In view of these findings, we propose a treatment algorithm for patients with BPPV. The present study demonstrated that additional exercise training, which emphasizes vestibular stimulation, can improve balance ability and functional gait performance among patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who had already undergone the canalith repositioning manoeuvre. VR is a simple, inexpensive, and beneficial treatment, and may be an appropriate first stage of management for many dizzy patients in primary care. This study takes the first step toward determining the efficacy of a specific exercise approach for reducing dizziness and imbalance in patients with chronic peripheral vestibular disorders. Combination of the two treatment leads to symptom remission in 100% of the patients at three months of treatment. Retention of the early beneficial effects even one year after surgery stresses the importance of customized vestibular rehabilitation. This investigation is continuing as a long-term follow-up study to determine whether there are any long-term benefits in participating in a VR program. These results support two possible mechanisms of BPPV: displaced otoconia and a neural mechanism affecting interpretation of semicircular canal signals. Vestibular exercises are effective in reducing the duration of symptoms and the need of medication of patients in the early stages of peripheral vestibular disorders. Most compensation occurs within 3 weeks, probably due to central mechanisms, although some measures may not recover completely. The DVA-predictable would benefit more from this than would DVA-unpredictable. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) VR is helpful for most patients in providing locomotor stability, but further work is needed to determine the factors that prevent VR from being effective for all patients with vestibulopathy. Visual motion and visuo-vestibular conflict situations should be incorporated in the rehabilitation of patients with refractory dizziness. The results from this study did not show TNS to be superior to AR in reducing tinnitus, dizziness or increasing hearing ability. In our experience, a rehabilitation programme seems to reduce dependence on visual cues for postural control. This prospective clinical study suggests that specific vestibular exercises improve vestibulospinal compensation in patients with acute peripheral vestibular lesions. The results suggest that vestibular adaptation exercises result in improved postural stability and in a diminished perception of dysequilibrium."
104,CD008643,"Radiation exposure and medical cost of noncontributory studies may be substantially reduced by judicious consideration of the potential diagnostic yield of the examination and by careful selection of repeated or follow-up studies. Some red flags have very high false-positive rates, indicating that, when used in isolation, they have little diagnostic value in the primary care setting. The indications for radiography of the lumbar spine in the A&E department are discussed. The prevalence of possible serious conditions was very low in all age categories, which implies radiation exposure in many patients with no significant lesions. Four clinical findings were present in significantly different frequencies between the positive group and others: an abnormal physical examination (90% vs 61.5%, respectively) (P less than .0001), tenderness (72.5% vs 41.2%) (P less than .0005), multiple positive findings (42.5% vs 20.7%) (P less than .005), and contusion or abrasion (15% vs 2.7%) (P less than .0005). It may not, however, reduce x-ray utilization from current levels without further refinement in the criteria."
105,CD002992,"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Unlike atenolol and propranolol, celiprolol was highly bronchosparing and did not antagonize sympathomimetic bronchodilators. Bisoprolol has been shown to exhibit a greater beta 1-selectivity than atenolol. Labetalol may be a safer antihypertensive than metoprolol in patients with concomitant bronchial asthma. When given acutely, celiprolol appeared to have acute bronchosparing properties, possibly providing a greater margin of respiratory safety than atenolol. Bronchospasm induced by atenolol 50 mg and xamoterol 200 mg was completely reversed by inhalation of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline to a cumulative dose of 4.0 mg. Such a treatment will be less likely to cause a troublesome increase in airways resistance and the bronchodilator action of the beta 2 stimulant will be almost fully preserved. Moreover, in the context of this study, since the beta-blockers were given in doses likely to induce equivalent cardiac beta-blockade, there is no evidence to suggest that any one of them is more "cardioselective" than the others. This study indicates, that when a larger dose of metoprolol is used in patients with obstructive lung disease, slow-release durules are to be preferred to ordinary tablets. Increased airflow obstruction prevents this reduction being of therapeutic value. On these acute studies, the order of preference for beta blocking drugs in management of hypertension in patients with obstructive airways disease, would be labetalol, (atenolol) or (metoprolol) and then propranolol. No correlation was found between the plasma levels of the beta-blockers and the changes in the ventilatory indices, HR or BP. Celiprolol more closely approached placebo in its respiratory effects than did atenolol, although the differences were not statistically significant. 5 Partial agonist activity did not appear to be clinically useful. Another possibility is that atenolol and terbutaline effect large and small airways function equally. It was concluded that, in patients with asthma who require beta blockade, atenolol is the preferred agent, co-prescribed with a beta2 stimulant. Differences in cardioselectivity between atenolol and metoprolol could thus not be shown. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The results show a selectivity of metoprolol for so-called beta1-receptors and indicate that metoprolol may be used in asthmatics provided that it is combined with beta2-receptor-stimulating drugs. Thus, preliminary results are unable to demonstrate adverse effects from celiprolol in patients with asthma and hypertension. Because of its bronchosparing properties, even at high doses, celiprolol may offer an advantage over other, similar agents in the treatment of hypertension and angina in asthmatics. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The results indicate that the new OROS delivery system for metoprolol, which produces a relatively constant plasma drug level, provides a cardioselectivity comparable to or greater than that of atenolol at maximum plasma levels. We conclude that metoprolol may be safely administered to a subset of stable patients with chronic reactive airways disease. In any individual the beta-adrenoceptor blocking response is unpredictable and any beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug must be used with extreme caution in asthmatics."
106,CD000024,"Because of the small number of patients it is impossible to evaluate the safety. Low-dose calcium heparin given subcutaneously following acute stroke reduced the number of deep-vein thromboses, pulmonary emboli and deaths without increasing the number of haemorrhagic strokes in this study. Results of this study do not support the use of intravenous heparin to treat patients who have had acute partial stroke. These results suggest that argatroban provides safe anticoagulation in acute ischemic stroke, warranting future studies powered to evaluate its efficacy and more precisely estimate event rates. Numerous standard laboratory tests confirmed that CY 222 was well tolerated. Despite an apparent positive response to treatment at 7 days, emergent administration of the antithrombotic agent, ORG 10172, is not associated with an improvement in favorable outcome at 3 months. These results suggest that the longer a patient remains without DVT prophylaxis after a stroke, the greater the risk of developing DVT and this supports early prophylaxis before rehabilitation. We conclude that LMW heparin in the dose range studied did not provide efficient prophylaxis against DVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The mesoglycan was very well tolerated and no side-effects were observed during the treatment. A statistically significant reduction was observed in deep-vein thrombosis as assessed by isotope leg scanning."
107,CD002892,"Because two main problems were encountered in this study, a high drop-out due to job turnover among nurses and the imitation of the intervention by the control group, several additional analyses were performed. Results indicate that health-care providers can be taught to employ adaptive coping strategies that improve levels of burnout, but long-term changes are achieved only through long-term coping training. It is suggested that even brief teaching of relaxation techniques may reduce work stress levels and promote a sense of psychophysiologic health in Chinese nurses who are employed in large teaching hospitals in Taiwan. The data also demonstrate the need to consolidate the skills acquired by regular post-training sessions. Implications of these findings are discussed. We suggest that psychosocial empowerment programmes are beneficial when organizational changes are enacted in health care settings. The implications of this study for clinical practice and future research will be discussed. Although results outline PTP efficacy, they indicate the need to design PTP, amplifying the transfer of learned CS to clinical practice. Outcomes suggest the need for further research with a larger population to assess this intervention's impact on anxiety, stress, self-care and caring relationships. A cost-effective, 6-session RMM protocol reduces burnout and mood dimensions, as well as TMD, in long-term care workers. Overall, the results indicate clear support for the effectiveness of assertiveness training for treating subassertive behaviors and stress in a population of professional nurses in Taiwan. The application of relaxation training in enhancing mental health status for nurses and health professionals is discussed. In these new studies, special attention should be given to the optimization of the implementation process of emotion-oriented care programs. The gains made by the inexperienced nurses may have been more associated with increases in their understanding of stress and their feelings of control over stress than with changes in their actual stress management behavior."
108,CD004194,"Despite a low statistical power, the high rate of negative response with placebo (50%) suggests that controlled trials are needed to assess the real efficacy of any treatment in patients with vasovagal syncope. It is concluded that cardiac pacing does not prevent or even delay the onset of postural syncope and infer that bradycardia is an unimportant component of vasovagal attacks. A possible placebo effect of pacemaker implantation occurred in 22% of patients. Recurrence of syncope after the investigative protocol was infrequent over long-term follow-up regardless of treatment group. In this small, but tightly controlled, study, propranolol did not prevent tilt-induced vasodilatation, syncope or elevated plasma adrenaline. Midodrine is recommended for the treatment of neurocardiogenic syncope in patients with frequent symptoms. Randomized controlled studies are essential to assess the real usefulness of any proposed therapy for patients with vasovagal syncope. There was no advantage with high rate intervention in delaying the loss of consciousness (or intolerable symptoms) after the initial onset of symptoms. The efficacy of therapy seems to be not predicted by HUT. These data suggest that DDD pacing with rate drop response function is effective in cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope and may be preferable to DDI pacing with rate hysteresis. DDD pacing with rate-drop response function is more effective than beta-blockade for the prevention of syncopal recurrences in highly symptomatic vasovagal fainters with relative bradycardia during tilt-induced syncope. The reproducibility of acute tilt-table testing is only 63% and suggests caution in the interpretation of acute drug testing during tilt-table studies. In both groups, HUTT performed one month after the treatment had no role in prediction of responders. Because of the weak evidence of efficacy of pacemaker therapy and the risk of complications, pacemaker therapy should not be recommended as first-line therapy for patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The results of this pilot study suggest that treatment of vasodepressor CSS with midodrine significantly reduced the rate of symptom reporting and attenuated SBP decreases after CSM but increased mean 24-hour ambulatory BP. Dual-chamber pacing with rate-drop response reduces the likelihood of syncope in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. The optimum pacing mode for individual patients cannot be predicted by simple cardiovascular tests before pacing. A negative result of tilt testing was not a useful means to evaluate therapy efficacy. Irrespective of the therapeutical choice, the "controlled reproduction" of symptoms and some psychophysical training of patients to avoid precipitating circumstances, to recognize early symptoms promptly to be reverted by Trendelemburg position, may produce the same clinical improvement as (empiric) ethylephrine or propranolol therapy. Paroxetine was found to significantly improve the symptoms of patients with vasovagal syncope unresponsive to or intolerant of traditional medications and was well tolerated by patients. From this study, we conclude that enalapril can prevent NMS in patients, presumably because of its part in the inhibition of CA release from sympathetic nerve endings. Thus, the outcome of either treated or untreated patients was favorable (with a low recurrence rate of syncope), and the usefulness of tilting-guided medical therapy remains uncertain. In conclusion, symptoms recur in most patients with untreated carotid sinus syndrome, and pacing is a useful therapy for preventing recurrences. This limited trial (1) supports the conclusion that patients with an abnormal ATP test who receive a dual-chamber pacemaker suffer fewer recurrences than those who are monitored only; and (2) consequently further supports the hypothesis that, among vasovagal patients, a cardiac pause of longer than 10 s in patients administered ATP identifies those at high risk of symptomatic vagal cardiac inhibition. However, it improves patients' well-being and might be more effective in reducing presyncopes and total vasovagal events in some patients with recurrent VVS. To prevent recurrence of symptoms, dose adjustments were required in about one third of patients. High doses were more effective and a careful dose titration period helped to minimise withdrawal symptoms and side effects. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity should be considered in all older adults who have non-accidental falls. Our data were unable to show a superiority of active pacing versus inactive pacing in preventing syncopal recurrence in patients with severe recurrent tilt-induced vasovagal syncope. These results indicate that midodrine significantly improves orthostatic tolerance during head-up tilt in patients with recurrent neurally mediated syncope. Propranolol, nadolol and placebo are equally effective treatments in VVS, as demonstrated by a reduction in the recurrence of syncope and presyncope, as well as an improvement in the patients' well-being. QOL was similar in the two pacing modes. Pacemaker treatment effectively reduced syncope and/or resulted in milder symptoms. This double-blind randomized trial of transdermal scopolamine demonstrated no significant effect of preventing vasovagal syncope. Thus, in patients with unexplained syncope, HUT appears to have a high degree of acute reproducibility, and the acute drug response guided by HUT may be used to develop an effective long-term pharmacological therapy. Copyright 1999 The European Society of Cardiology. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The recurrence of neurocardiogenic syncope in highly symptomatic patients treated with atenolol is similar to that of patients treated with placebo. Metoprolol was not effective in preventing vasovagal syncope in the study population. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that verapamil is considerably less efficacious than metoprolol in managing neurocardiogenic syncope."
109,CD006455,"Further studies of the potential efficacy of ethyl-EPA are warranted. One year of Cr intake, at a rate that can improve muscle functional capacity in healthy subjects and patients with neuromuscular disease (5 g/day), did not improve functional, neuromuscular, and cognitive status in patients with stage I to III HD. The study also identified various indices of disease progression, including motor tests and PET studies, that were sensitive to deterioration over time. This argues for multicenter efforts for future therapeutic trials in HD. Antioxidant therapy may slow the rate of motor decline early in the course of Huntington's disease. Our patients declined at a pace slower than that observed in other prospective studies, a finding likely due to selection criteria, avoidance of neuroleptic therapy, and strong psychosocial support."
110,CD009154,"In conclusion, dydrogesterone is effective in luteal-phase support in ART. hCG in combination with progesterone for luteal support was suggested to benefit women undergoing IVF with low late-midluteal estradiol levels. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Estradiol supplementation during the luteal phase in women undergoing IVF/ICSI-ET has a beneficial effect on the outcome without (at least, as seems from this study) having any adverse effects. Vaginal cream for better bioavailability and acceptance appear the most suitable and comfortable method for luteal phase support. There were no statistically significant differences in terms of implantation rate (34.9% [51 of 146] vs. 28.9% [41 of 142]), ongoing pregnancy rate 42% ([34 of 81] vs. 41.8% [33 of 79]), early pregnancy loss (15% [6 of 40] vs. 13.2% [5 of 38]), or multiple pregnancy rate (28.6% [12 of 42] vs. 24.4% [10/41]) in patients receiving P versus E(2) + P. The addition of transdermal E(2) to the luteal-phase P support of IVF cycles did not improve cycle outcomes in terms of implantation and pregnancy rates. progesterone as luteal support in IVF cycles in which GnRHa is used in the ultrashort protocol. One daily dose appears sufficient to induce clinical pregnancies and live births at a rate comparable to intramuscular supplementation. Trials registry number-ISRCTN: 88722916. We recommend the use of injectable P, and suggest reserving intravaginal P as a second choice for patients who cannot tolerate intramuscular administration. As low dose micronized progesterone administered vaginally is simple, easy and well tolerated, it could be recommended as the method of choice for luteal support, especially for high responder patients at risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. On the basis of our results, we emphasize the use of 17-OHPc for luteal phase support after IVF and embryo transfer. Oral micronized P4 supplementation appears to be a convenient method of supporting serum P4 levels during the luteal phase after IVF. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Copyright (c) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel. However, oral progesterone results in a reduced implantation rate per embryo. Although none of these forms of luteal support adequately 'normalised' luteal progesterone profiles, this did not appear to be detrimental to the process of implantation. Endometrin was safe and well tolerated. It appears that the addition of E2 to progesterone in the luteal phase after stimulation with rFSH and GnRH antagonist does not enhance the probability of pregnancy. The optimal methods for luteal support may be dependent on responses to stimulation with gonadotropin, although it is not concluded that oral chlormadinone acetate is recommended as an option for luteal support in high responders. In women undergoing IVF-ET, once-a-day progesterone supplementation with Crinone 8%, beginning the day after oocyte retrieval, resulted in significantly lower embryo implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates compared with women supplemented with IM progesterone. Because pregnancy rates and ongoing pregnancy rates were similar with and without estrogen supplementation (50.0% vs. 55.2% and 36.6% vs. 34.4%, respectively), we concluded that luteal estrogen supplementation in fixed multidose GnRH antagonist cycles did not change the pregnancy rates significantly. The two recommended regimens of P supplementation in ART proved to be equivalent and safe. Extending GnRHa treatment through the luteal phase appeared not to have a significant impact on pregnancy or implantation rates in intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles. There were no differences between the treatments with regard to liver function tests. This paper discusses the question of how we can come to a definite conclusion on the efficacy of hormonal supplementation during the luteal phase. Additional early luteal-phase vaginal progesterone supplementation may improve the outcome of IVF-ET in women with fibroids or difficult oocyte retrieval. The ongoing pregnancy and the living birth rates per transfer were significantly higher in the patients supplemented with intramuscular P than in those treated with vaginal gel P. The intramuscular natural P appears the most suitable route of administration for luteal phase support in IVF-ET procedures. Single 0.1 mg triptorelin administration 6 days after ICSI following ovarian stimulation with the long GnRH agonist protocol does not seem to result in an increase >or=12% in ongoing pregnancy rates. injections. The data indicate that supplementation of the luteal phase may not improve the success rates of IVF-ET cycles. The fact that Crinone matches the efficacy of the larger doses of progesterone used orally reflects an advantage of the transvaginal route of administration which avoids the metabolic inactivation of progesterone during its first liver pass. Luteal-phase GnRH agonist administration enhances ICSI clinical outcomes after GnRH agonist- and GnRH antagonist-treated ovarian stimulation cycles, possibly by a combination of effects on the embryo and the corpus luteum.

Although LNG and NETA affected secondary markers differently, both OC formulations produced an equivalent decrease in bioavailable. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrates that a low-dose OC containing 20 microg of EE and 100 microg of LNG is an effective and safe treatment for moderate acne. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Both desogestrel/ethinylestradiol and gestodene/ethinylestradiol provide effective oral contraception with comparable cycle control and acceptability. The reduction in acne with the combiphasic oral contraceptive was comparable to a preparation containing the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate. Furthermore, the effects of both oral contraceptives were comparable. Oral contraceptives containing EE/desogestrel and EE/levonorgestrel were both effective in treating acne. During treatment with both preparations all values measured were within the normal range. In addition to its contraceptive efficacy described elsewhere, EE/CMA is an effective treatment for moderate papulopustular acne and other androgen-related skin disorders. These data show that NOMAC/E2 provides high contraceptive efficacy with acceptable cycle control as well as an overall adverse event profile similar to that of DRSP/EE. In conclusion, owing to the unique pharmacologic activities of drospirenone, the combined oral contraceptive EE/DRSP provides an effective treatment option in female patients with mild to moderate acne. The decrease in 3 alpha-17 beta-androstanediol was statistically significantly more pronounced in the Diane-35 group. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel This new preparation may provide useful hormone therapy for women with androgen-dependent disorders who also require contraception. EE/DNG was superior to placebo, in spite of the prominent placebo effects, and as effective as EE/CPA in the treatment of mild to moderate acne, thus proving a valid option for the treatment of acne in women seeking oral contraception. The 3 mg drsp/20 mcg EE 24/4 regimen COC was significantly more effective than placebo in treating moderate acne vulgaris. In conclusion, the biochemical and clinical efficacy of EE-GTD and EE-DSG indicate that both these preparations can be a good choice in the therapy of acne vulgaris, with a non-significant better clinical result with EE-DSG. A low-dose oral contraceptive containing EE/LNG is effective and safe for the treatment of moderate acne. A triphasic combination of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is an effective treatment for moderate acne vulgaris in women with no known contraindication to OC therapy. It is likely that the improvement was in connection with the free testosterone decrease and the improvement was better in the desogestrel/EE group where also SHBG elevation was seen. The safety profile was consistent with low-dose combined oral contraceptive use. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc. An OC containing 0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol combined with the triphasic regimen of norgestimate is a safe and effective treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women with no known contraindication to OC therapy.

116,CD007066,"This study, which is the first to assess the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of aliskiren in Japanese patients with hypertension, demonstrates that the once-daily oral renin inhibitor aliskiren provides significant, dose-dependent reductions in blood pressure with placebo-like tolerability. Renin inhibition with aliskiren neutralized the compensatory rise in PRA induced by HCTZ. The combination of aliskiren and valsartan at maximum recommended doses provides significantly greater reductions in blood pressure than does monotherapy with either agent in patients with hypertension, with a tolerability profile similar to that with aliskiren and valsartan alone. Direct renin inhibition with aliskiren therefore represents an effective option for the long-term treatment of essential hypertension.

117,CD007224,"The off-pump technique may provide a positive contribution and sufficient protection on postoperative renal functions in patients undergoing CABG. The lower postoperative neutrophil counts occurring in the CPB group may be explained by the activation and consequent sequestration of the neutrophils in the CPB circuit and tissues. Cardiopulmonary bypass exacerbates the catabolism and disturbed glucose homeostasis that is induced also to a lesser degree by surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass. The lower release of cardiac troponin I in the beating heart revascularization group indicates that conventional coronary artery bypass graft with cardioplegic arrest causes more damage to the heart than off-pump myocardial revascularization. Avoidance of CPB significantly decreased mechanical ventilation support and length of intensive care unit and postoperative stay; however in the absence of risk factors for cardiopulmonary bypass, off-pump coronary artery surgery did not improve early and midterm clinical outcome. Increased ET in the postoperative period may contribute to a more complex recovery from coronary artery bypass surgery in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. http://clinicaltrials.gov/number, NCT00120991. Long-term health outcomes with off-pump coronary artery bypass are similar to those with coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass when both operations are performed by experienced surgeons. Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society Off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery results in less neurocognitive impairment than the on-pump technique. The present study suggests that off-pump CABG, when technically feasible, significantly reduces morbidity following surgery in a group of high-risk patients. Off-pump coronary bypass graft operation on a beating heart significantly reduces oxidative stress and suppresses the inflammatory reaction associated with the use of CPB. Our roTEG results display a slightly greater, but fairly subtle activation of fibrinolysis during the course of cardiopulmonary bypass, compared to off-pump cardiac surgery. These results suggest that avoidance of CPB does not offer additional renoprotection to patients at low risk of perioperative renal insult during CABG. In summary, we didn't find no superiority in any of the two techniques regarding on hospital mortality and morbidity. Copyright (c) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel. The investigation revealed that inflammatory response reactions following extracorporeal circulation could be reduced significantly using the off-pump technique. Operations performed with the use of CPB are associated with a more pronounced release of PTX3 immediately after operation. Further studies are needed in order to confirm this hypothesis. This may contribute to improved organ function, subsequently resulting in improved postoperative recovery from surgical revascularization procedures, particularly in critically ill patients. Further large-scale studies are needed to show whether this result is reflected by fewer neurologic deficits. These patients can be operated on using the beating heart technique or by using MIDCABG to prevent side effects of CPB on pulmonary function and effects of sternotomy. Off-pump coronary revascularization, with or without RVAD, reduces inflammatory response, myocardial, neurologic, and renal injury, and decreases hemolysis when compared with conventional surgery with CPB and cardioplegic arrest. Off-pump surgery showed better results than on-pump surgery in patients who underwent surgery within 6 hours from the onset of symptoms and in patients with cardiogenic shock. Miniaturized extracorporeal circulation can be considered similar to off-pump surgery in terms of systemic inflammatory response, myocardial inflammation and damage, and early outcome. Except for the complement system and elastase, on-pump surgery with SMA-coated circuits did not elicit any greater inflammatory response than off-pump surgery. Cardiac troponin I and heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, but not high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, served as superior diagnostic discriminators of perioperative myocardial damage after on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Off-pump CABG with multiple arterial grafts was as safe as the conventional on-pump CABG, with similar completeness of revascularization and early graft patency. When comparing OPCAB with CABG, oxygenation was more affected and only part of the systemic inflammatory response was attenuated. The splanchnic pathophysiology during beating-heart revascularization should be further explored. This study provides evidence that CABG with the use of CPB in comparison to OPCAB surgery is associated with a significantly more pronounced endothelial response in the immediate postoperative period. Thirty-day complications, neuropsychological functioning, and one-year clinical and functional outcomes were not statistically different between the two techniques. Neither CPB nor surgical access influenced the clinical outcome in the treatment of coronary artery single-vessel bypass grafting. This finding warrants further laboratory and clinical confirmation in the future. Off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery was associated with substantially lower levels of troponin release after surgery. Delayed-enhancement MRI is a powerful predictor of myocardial viability after surgery, suggesting an important role for this technique in clinical viability assessment. However, release of creatinine kinase was lower in the off-pump group showing that cardiopulmonary bypass has more deleterious effects later after the operation. Patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafts without cardiopulmonary bypass did not show fewer cognitive deficits or greater improvement in quality of life. In this randomized study in low-risk coronary patients, OPCAB revealed less perioperative oxidative stress, as reflected by lack of excretion of iPF2alpha-III in urine, by lack of increase of plasma free malondialdehyde, and by lower decreases in plasma total antioxidant status. OPCAB attenuates sub-clinical AKI, in diabetic patients. Further studies with angiographic evaluation are needed to establish a correlation between coagulation parameters, platelet function, and graft patency. Patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery showed similar patency of grafts, better clinical outcome, shorter hospital stay, and better neurocognitive function than patients who underwent conventional coronary artery bypass grafting surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. The risk of retinal embolism can be minimized by the use of OPCAB and, most likely, by adequate epiaortic ultrasound scanning of the ascending aorta and avoiding clamping in case of severely diseased aorta. The present aspirin strategy seems to be insufficient in the early postoperative period, irrespective of the surgical technique used. Cardiopulmonary bypass did not cause additional changes in tested histology variables. Off-pump surgery did not better preserve right ventricular systolic and diastolic function than did conventional coronary surgery. Nevertheless, it has to be stated that the rate of incomplete revascularization in this early series of CABG without CPB is higher, and compromises the basic principle of complete revascularization. Our findings indicate that multiregional warm ischaemia, caused by snaring of the diseased coronary artery, causes considerably less myocardial injury than global cold ischaemia induced by cardioplegic cardiac arrest. No respiratory failure occurred in group A; two patients experienced slow weaning from ventilation assistance and one died from that complication in group B. Myocardial revascularization without CPBP allows a better postoperative clinical course in patients with advanced pulmonary disease. This study shows that increase in PAI-1 antigen values in patients who undergo off-pump (beating heart) CABG is significantly higher than in those who undergo conventional CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass.

For both groups, the majority of patients reported improved health after coronary artery bypass graft surgery compared with their preoperative status. It may achieve the benefits of OPCABG (less morbidity in high-risk patients) while facilitating complete revascularization in the case of complex lesions unsuitable for OPCABG. We did not find any statistical difference in hospital mortality and morbidity using on-pump or off-pump techniques for low-risk patients. OPCAB reduces complement activation compared with on-pump CABG but does not significantly affect TNF-alpha and IL-8 release or endothelial function. In addition, we have shown no correlation between S100 beta and the total microemboli count, possibly because of the small numbers in this study. These data suggest that patients who undergo minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting have a significant reduction in the systemic inflammatory response, postoperative morbidity, and hospital stay compared with patients who undergo conventional coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. MDRD GFR is a more sensitive investigation than serum creatinine levels to assess renal insufficiency in patients undergoing coronary bypass. Postoperative hepatocellular injury was worse with the CABG-CPB group. Unique identifier: ISRCTN66068876. OPCAB may provide complete revascularization that is durable and cost-effective. The off-pump technique appears to be promising in order to eliminate the source of these neuropyschologic impairments following CABG operation. The off-pump procedure in the unselected patient population results in fewer patent saphenous grafts per patient. The pulmonary gas exchange postoperatively is comparable to standard cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, but a reduced postoperative pulmonary shunt was seen in the stabilization group. CABG on a beating heart is associated with better myocardial energy preservation and less myocardial damage compared with conventional CABG with CPB and intermittent antegrade mild hypothermic blood cardioplegia. The distinct increase of plasma tissue factor occurring after both surgical procedures might represent a mechanism that might explain, in part, the early postoperative prothrombotic state occurring after on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. These changes have no impact on the postoperative clinical outcome; no significant difference between the groups was found. With these properties, this technique could take an important place in the cardiac surgeon's armamentarium. Improvement in functional class and exercise capacity was the same in both groups. Copyright 2009 Massachusetts Medical Society. Imaging of part of the cerebral circulation provides evidence to validate markers of cerebral injury. After coronary bypass surgery, there is a protracted postoperative activation of inflammation persisting several days after surgery; this postoperative activation is not affected by the surgical strategy (on-pump or off-pump). Compared with CABG, OPCAB may reduce neurologic and clinical morbidity as well as cost. Cardiopulmonary bypass is not responsible for these changes in oxygen metabolism. (2) Coronary bypass surgery causes the early activation of lymphocytes, as evidenced by the increased expression of lymphocyte activation markers. Cardiopulmonary bypass, inclusive of cardioplegic arrest, is the main independent predictor of post-operative gastrointestinal complications in patients undergoing coronary revascularisation. We recommend the use of autologous blood transfusion in both on- and off-pump CABG surgery. There was a tendency toward less activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis in low-risk patients during elective off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery when compared with on-pump surgery. isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN69438133."
118,CD002200,"Patients subjected to intensive follow-up have recurrence diagnosed earlier, and have more operations for recurrence, but the survival results suggest that any major improvement by intensive follow-up is unlikely. Our data support use of an intense follow-up plan after primary resection of large-bowel cancer, at least in patients with rectal cancer. Risk-adapted follow-up has significantly improved the targeting of curative re-operations and overall survival of patients independently of risk of recurrence and has allowed a reduction in the costs of following up of disease-free patients. Inclusion of regular performance of colonoscopy seems justified up to the fifth year of follow-up, at least. Colon cancer patients with follow-up led by surgeons or general practitioners experience similar outcomes, although patterns of investigation vary. Yearly colonoscopy, liver CT, and chest radiography will not improve survival from colorectal cancer when added to symptom and simple screening review."
119,CD003260,"Although qualitatively derived benefits differed across groups, similarities in program content reduced the potential for quantitative differentiation among the groups. Since neuropsychological improvements were best documented after 8 and 16 weeks and faded towards the end of the treatment period, it must be concluded that this symptomatic therapy is mainly of short-term benefit and was overcome by the progressive pathological changes at the end of the treatment period. Results suggest that although face-name training, spaced retrieval, and cognitive stimulation may produce small gains in learning personal information and on a measure of attention, improvement does not generalize to overall neuropsychologic functioning or patient quality of life. Our results suggest that computer based cognitive training in patients with AD and mild cognitive decline is effective at least in delaying the continuous progression of cognitive impairment in AD. CR offers a means of assisting people with early-stage AD and their families in managing the effects of the condition. These results suggest that although modest gains in learning and memory may be evident in AD patients who are taught specific strategies, the benefits do not generalize to other measures of neuropsychological functioning after a brief intervention. These findings support the viability of remediation interventions in dementia despite the trajectory of cognitive decline. A systematic program of cognitive rehabilitation can result in maintained improvement in performance on specific cognitive and functional tasks in mildly impaired AD patients. These results suggest that the active participation of the caregiver matters in cognitive dementia rehabilitation."
120,CD007672,"Such nurses can significantly improve the quality of life for patients dying outside of institutions. Home care may also include assisting patients in acknowledging the reality of their situation. The results suggest that routines like those implemented through intensified primary care may be an effective strategy to increase the accessibility and continuity of care, especially for elderly people and for patients with a need for long-term contacts. Copyright 2001 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain. Early discharge seems to enhance the opportunity for social support within the family. An intervention including patient education, a pain diary, and defining a procedure for therapeutic adjustments can be effective to improve pain relief in outpatients with cancer. Experienced nurses with specialized knowledge of oncology symptom assessment and management may reduce the symptom burden experienced by ambulatory patients with breast or lung cancer during active treatment. Additional research is needed to test home care interventions aimed at maintaining quality of life outcomes and their effects on survival of post-surgical cancer patients. We suggest that telephone follow-up be coordinated among health professionals. (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. More research is needed to improve the quality of care for inpatients with cancer-related pain. These findings suggest that comprehensive pain assessment and evidence-based analgesic decision-making processes do enhance usual pain outcomes. This coordinating service made little difference to patient or family outcomes, perhaps because the service did not have a budget with which it could obtain services or because the professional skills of the nurse-coordinators may have conflicted with the requirements of the coordinating role. The findings of the current study indicated that a computer-assisted, nurse-driven intervention was capable of providing durable improvements in the quality of life of men who underwent treatment for clinically localized prostate carcinoma. Results support the important role of nurses in addressing mental health issues in patients and families experiencing cancer. Randomised trials may prove to be impracticable for evaluation of palliative care. Factors such as the long-standing relationship women had with their GP, the perceived lack of specialist knowledge on the part of GPs and district nurses, and the women's perception that information seeking was not a tangible reason for primary care contact had an impact on information-seeking behaviour. Nurse led follow up was acceptable to lung cancer patients and general practitioners and led to positive outcomes. When discussing follow-up with breast cancer patients, they should be provided with complete and accurate information about the goals, expectations, and limitations of the follow-up programme so that they can make an informed choice. Continued access to pain related information using either a patient- or provider-initiated format did not affect long-term pain outcomes. However, if given the choice, most patients prefer to stay in hospital until their wound drains are removed. Nurse case management results in more appropriate management of older women with breast cancer. This intervention could have widespread application. Future research should consider providing the feedback to other health professionals and patients, and monitor the impact on the process of individual patient care. lower in the HBHC sample, indicating that expansion of VA HBHC to serve terminally ill veterans would increase satisfaction with care at no additional cost. There were significant reductions in functional decline with inpatient geriatric evaluation and management and improvements in mental health with outpatient geriatric evaluation and management, with no increase in costs. Age, sex, site or stage of cancer, and supportive medications did not modify the effect of this cognitive behavioral intervention on symptom severity. It is recommended that it should be made available to patients on request and used by them according to need. A phase III trial targeting patients with inadequate experienced continuity of care is recommended. Case conferences between GPs and specialist palliative care services may be warranted for palliative care patients. Further research should focus on identifying features such as feedback loops that are required for the successful and meaningful use of QOL questionnaires in routine patient care. With knowledge of the role that continuing-care intervention plays in social support and disease uncertainty, nurses and other healthcare professionals can continue to explore and strengthen strategies to enhance the coping ability of women with breast cancer in Taiwan. A supplementary patient-held record for radiotherapy outpatients appears to have no effect on satisfaction with communication, participation in care, or quality of life. Routine assessment of cancer patients' HRQL had an impact on physician-patient communication and resulted in benefits for some patients, who had better HRQL and emotional functioning. While no statistically significant improvements in patient satisfaction or GP confidence were shown, the data suggested that GPs value contact to meet patient information needs. However, to achieve improvements on a group level of the various dimensions of quality of life, specific interventions directed toward specific symptoms or problems may have to be defined, evaluated, and included in the program. Oncology nurses should develop telenursing programs that include patient and family education regarding oncology issues. Colon cancer patients with follow-up led by surgeons or general practitioners experience similar outcomes, although patterns of investigation vary. These data reflect a high standard of care of patients dying of cancer and other chronic diseases in an acute hospital environment, but do not demonstrate a difference between the two models of service delivery of specialist palliative care. More research is necessary to define cost-effective interventions. While this is a small step in the right direction, the need remains for new initiatives and further studies into how to improve cooperation and communication between the primary and secondary healthcare sectors. However, identification of patients with moderate or severe levels of depression may be valuable in reducing subsequent levels of depression. Future studies should focus on the long-term systematic incorporation of simple pain-assessment tools into daily outpatient oncology practices as well as on innovative ways to address other aspects of managing cancer pain. Our findings suggest that although reminders have some role in improving cancer pain management, a more intensive approach is needed for a generalized nursing workforce with limited recent exposure to state-of-the-art pain management practices."
121,CD002783,"Factors favoring a good outcome of acute venous thrombosis were (1) no prior thrombotic disease, (2) localized thrombosis, and (3) prompt streptokinase therapy. It is concluded that patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with proximal extension of the thrombus beyond the calf veins should be offered a therapeutic trial with streptokinase. Patients with recently formed thromboses in the lower leg and popliteal veins who underwent 7 days of locoregional lysis treatment with urokinase demonstrated significantly fewer clinical symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome after 1 year than those who received locoregional treatment with rt-PA over a similar period or a control group treated with anticoagulants only. Thus, it seems important to limit the extent of a CVT in order to minimize the long-term sequelae, but administration of SK is not justified due to side-effects. Bleeding complications classified as major were noted in 8/25 patients receiving the combined treatment. Given the inherent risks for such serious complications, systemic thrombolysis, although effective, should be used selectively in limb-threatening thrombotic situations. When diagnosis was delayed there was a very great risk of permanent damage to the valves. in the short-term patients treated with catheter directed thrombolysis obtained better patency and competence than those treated with standard anticoagulation. At long-term follow-up, three (25 percent) of 12 patients in whom greater than 50 percent lysis was achieved had symptoms of the postphlebitic syndrome, compared with 19 (56 percent) of 34 patients in whom lysis was less than 50 percent (p = 0.07). (1) rt-PA and rt-PA plus heparin cause more clot lysis than heparin alone; (2) the addition of heparin to rt-PA does not improve the lysis rate; (3) DVT treated with heparin is commonly associated with a rise in the transaminase level; (4) heparin does not increase the risk of bleeding from rt-PA therapy; and (5) alternative dosing regimens and modes of administration of rt-PA should be investigated to improve further its efficacy and safety in the treatment of acute DVT. Overt bleeding was noted in 6 patients."

123,CD000246,"Treatment with clindamycin appeared safe and well tolerated, with benefits limited to women who were less than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation. Adjuvant ampicillin and metronidazole in the management of women in preterm labour with intact membranes significantly prolonged the pregnancy and decreased neonatal morbidity. Further work is needed to identify markers of upper genital tract infection among women in preterm labor and to evaluate other potential therapeutic interventions. The results of this study do not support the routine use of antibiotic administration to women in preterm labor with intact membranes. Ceftizoxime had no effect on interval to delivery or duration of pregnancy in women treated for preterm labor. Treatment with ampicillin and metronidazole in women with threatened idiopathic preterm labour significantly prolonged the gestation, but had no effects on maternal and neonatal infectious morbidity. This trial provides evidence that antibiotics should not be routinely prescribed for women in spontaneous preterm labour without evidence of clinical infection. Significant differences in genital microflora between our patients and those of other studies may explain our results. A significant reduction in the rate of neonatal suspected sepsis was also demonstrated. In our population adjunctive ampicillin-sulbactam with indomethacin did not improve the success of magnesium sulfate tocolysis."
124,CD003594,"Further study should be performed to identify the effects of fish oil on this entity in nephrotic syndrome. Hypercholesterolemia antagonizes this effect of CSA. We conclude that CSA is more effective than CPH in inducing at least partial remission in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in children. The children who received IV cyclophosphamide had more sustained remissions, longer periods without proteinuria and fewer significant side effects; this was achieved at a lower cumulative dose. This study does not support the use of cyclosporine at the dose of 5 mg/kg/d in patients with steroid-resistant minimal lesion nephrotic syndrome or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The result suggested that fosinopril significantly reduced proteinuria and alleviated renal tubular damage, but did not influence blood pressure and components of systemic RAS in normotensive children with SRINS. Titration of the dose of enalapril may be a useful strategy for achieving substantial reduction of proteinuria in children with SRNS. Cyclophosphamide therapy for children with steroid-resistant FSGS is not recommended. Therapy with tacrolimus is a promising alternative to CsA in view of the lower risk of relapses and lack of cosmetic side effects. In patients with normal renal function and without severe hypertension, CsA at the therapeutic scheme adopted did not produce severe renal or extrarenal toxicity. In patients with SRNS, the efficacy of treatment intravenously with cyclophosphamide and orally with prednisolone was similar to the combination of dexamethasone intravenously, orally administered cyclophosphamide and prednisolone."
125,CD002255,"Nifedipine seems to be as effective as ritodrine in the treatment of preterm labor and is associated with less frequent side effects. We conclude that nifedipine may have a role in the treatment of preterm labor but suggest further careful evaluation of this agent before it is considered for routine clinical use. Oral nifedipine is as effective as magnesium sulfate and terbutaline in arresting and preventing idiopathic preterm labor. The use of nicardipine is an interesting alternative to salbutamol, especially in cases of hypertension, diabetes or maternal cardiopathy. However, the nifedipine group had fewer maternal and fetal complications. Nifedipine was found to be significantly more effective than ritodrine or withholding therapy, and was almost devoid of side-effects. The ease with which a calcium inhibitor can be given suggests that it should be used more frequently in the treatment of threatened premature labour and particularly when there are contra-indications to the use of beta-mimetic drugs. Nifedipine in comparison with ritodrine in the management of preterm labor is significantly associated with a longer postponement of deliver, fewer maternal side effects, and fewer admissions to the NICU. Nifedipine is a valid and well-tolerated alternative among the tocolytic drugs, and apparently does not significantly alter fetal vascular blood flow. Its use is associated with less frequent side effects. Patients who received magnesium sulfate were more likely to have adverse medication effects and recurrent preterm labor."
126,CD000460,"ASA idiosyncrasy is unsuspected in many patients and possibly overdiagnosed in others. Alteration in the bronchial reactivity after an oral challenge, appears to be a sensitive means of detecting tartrazine sensitivity. We conclude that tartrazine-benzoate dietary avoidance was not of value in the management of the chronic asthmatic in this study, even among patients who respond to challenge with these substances or have ASA idiosyncrasy. Thus, intolerance to tartrazine appears to be rare among Central-European and South-European patients with aspirin-induced asthma, its frequency amounting to about 2.6%."

The increased constraint provided by the FS1000 component did not appear to have any adverse effect on fixation of the femoral component. This finding has implications when planning blood replacement in cementless and hybrid-type arthroplasties. When using uncemented components, however, there is evidence that augmenting a porous surface with hydroxyapatite may mean less motion between implant and bone after the initial postoperative year. If HA-coated implants can sustain the forces that threaten the fixation in the early period after implantation, a strong and enduring fixation may be obtained."

133,CD006904,"In patients with neurologic diseases, a systematic approach to weaning and extubation reduces the rate of reintubation secondary to extubation failure without affecting the duration of mechanical ventilation, and is overall positively perceived by intensive care unit professionals. We conclude that protocol-directed weaning may be unnecessary in a closed ICU with generous physician staffing and structured rounds. Protocol-guided weaning of mechanical ventilation, as performed by nurses and respiratory therapists, is safe and led to extubation more rapidly than physician-directed weaning. The study suggests that use of the computer-directed weaning system results in fewer arterial blood gas samples, shorter weaning times, and less time spent outside acceptable RR and TV parameters. Daily screening of the respiratory function of adults receiving mechanical ventilation, followed by trials of spontaneous breathing in appropriate patients and notification of their physicians when the trials were successful, can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the cost of intensive care and is associated with fewer complications than usual care. Whether protocols combining respiratory parameters with neurologic measures lead to superior outcomes in this population requires further investigation. These results confirm that the use of a weaning algorithm enables the MV interval and hospital length of stay to be shortened, suggesting that it should be used in the management following cardiac surgery. Mechanical ventilation: weaning. These results, in conjunction with prior studies, suggest that VMPs are highly effective means of improving care, even in university ICUs."
134,CD003147,"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Thus in patients with cystic fibrosis positive expiratory pressure breathing increases lung volumes in relation to the expiratory pressure imposed; these changes in lung volume did not, however, lead to an improvement of mucus transport. It was concluded that PEP mask therapy is an acceptable and effective alternative to postural drainage in interval therapy of patients with cystic fibrosis, although the patients have tended to revert to postural drainage during acute exacerbations. PEP was well accepted by the patients, who preferred treatment C, and we suggest it is incorporated in chest physical therapy regimens if the therapeutic objective is to increase expectoration. The authors propose that improvements in gas mixing may lead to increases in oxygenation and thus functional exercise capacity. Our results indicate that for our patients with cystic fibrosis, pulmonary physiotherapy with the PEP technique was superior to conventional physiotherapy with the PD&P technique. Surprisingly, postural drainage (PD) was the most effective technique in the left, dependent lung in 7 of the 9 patients. Further studies involving multicenter trials are warranted to evaluate the effects of the Flutter on pulmonary function. Long-term comparison of both methods, including expectoration measurements, seems to be required for further evaluation of the potential success of physiotherapy in cystic fibrosis. PEP clears more sputum than AD or combined techniques; patients with airway hyperreactivity, however, should either prefer AD or should take a bronchodilator premedication before PEP. Flutter was not as effective in maintaining pulmonary function in this group of patients with CF compared with PEP and was more costly because of the increased number of hospitalizations and antibiotic use. The mask was well accepted and allowed independent treatment by older patients. Sputum clearance was less effective when positive expiratory pressure was included in the treatment regimen. Evaluation of TBC during chest physiotherapy when only based on the weight of sputum expectorated seems inadequate. Twenty-three patients chose to continue using the PEP mask in conjunction with FET long-term as their chest physiotherapy programme as they felt it was an effective treatment allowing increased independence, with postural drainage being kept to a minimum."
135,CD001059,"Calcium supplementation is beneficial for preventing pre-eclampsia among Iranian women at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia. The available evidence for systematic review of all the randomized trials of calcium supplementation shows benefit in reducing the risk of hypertension and preeclampsia. In addition, there was a small but significant increase in serum ionized calcium levels in the calcium-supplemented group during the treatment period. Pregnant women who receive calcium supplementation after the 20th week of pregnancy have a reduced risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Further research should be directed at understanding the mechanism of this effect and trying to demonstrate a reduction in pregnancy-induced hypertension with calcium supplementation in a larger population. In conclusion calcium supplementation given in pregnancy to nulliparous women reduces the incidence of pregnancy induced hypertension. If confirmed by future research, these results could represent an important preventive intervention for prematurity in high-risk populations. Calcium supplementation during pregnancy did not prevent preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertension, or adverse perinatal outcomes in healthy nulliparous women. A 1.5-g calcium/day supplement did not prevent preeclampsia but did reduce its severity, maternal morbidity, and neonatal mortality, albeit these were secondary outcomes. These results suggest that calcium supplementation during pregnancy in populations with low calcium intake is a safe, effective, and inexpensive preventive measure that significantly reduces the risk of preeclampsia."

Our data suggest that the influenza vaccine is safe and effective in children with either ALL or asthma in Taiwan. For each vaccine, the highest frequencies of increases in neutralizing antibody levels and the highest mean titers occurred in those given the 135- microg vaccine.

139,CD000345,"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Our medium term follow-up results indicate that a prolonged course of high dose interferon in children with chronic HB infection, regardless of prednisone priming, poorly affects response rates but significantly speeds termination of active viral replication. It is concluded that prednisone pretreatment does not have a beneficial effect in children with CHB. Treatment should be used with caution in patients with cirrhosis and avoided in patients showing signs, or with a history, of decompensated cirrhosis. Moreover, in about 10 percent of the patients treated with interferon, hepatitis B surface antigen disappeared from serum. We conclude that 6 weeks of prednisone followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon is of use in inducing persistent loss of hepatitis B virus DNA (16.1 per cent) and e-seroconversion (12.9 per cent) in a proportion of Chinese HBsAg carrier children: the prednisone probably enhances the immunomodulatory effect of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon. However, the response was significantly better in patients with elevated transaminase levels. Interferon was well tolerated, the side effects being less severe than in adults, and never led to suspension of the treatment. Steroid priming does not potentiate the effect of IFN-alpha. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) On long term follow up (four years), nine out of 28 responders (32.1%) eliminated HBsAg, and four initial non-responders had a late seroconversion.

PICC lines reduced the number of painful IV procedures in VLBW infants without additional morbidity. The number of skin punctures was significantly reduced in the PCVL group.

142,CD002246,"Results of this study suggest that age-appropriate safety education that is repetitive and individualized and that requires active parental participation results in an increase in parental knowledge and an improvement in certain safety practices. However, other factors, particularly ethnic and language background, were of greater influence. A targeted intervention involving a smoke-alarm-giveaway program can reduce the incidence of injuries from residential fires. No control group parents did so. These findings are encouraging for provision of injury prevention in primary care. Further research should focus on the effectiveness of safety promotion strategies which are expanded to include seniors participation, policy development and community planning and design. Product modification and environmental redesign must be instituted through education and legislation for successful control of burn injuries. The Safe Block Project could serve as a model for future urban injury prevention efforts. Giving out free smoke alarms in a deprived, multiethnic, urban community did not reduce injuries related to fire, mostly because few alarms had been installed or were maintained. Among the families of low income children enrolled in preschool enrichment programs, home safety inspections and the distribution of safety supplies by school based home visitors appears to improve knowledge and behavior related to poisoning, smoke detector installation, and car safety seat use over three months of follow up. Counseling coupled with convenient access to reduced-cost products appears to be an effective strategy for promoting children's home safety. Because low-income families face many barriers to carrying out the recommended safety practices, supplemental strategies are needed to ensure safer homes. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Only 65% of voucher households had functioning alarms at follow up, largely due to failure to redeem vouchers. The intervention package was not effective in reducing the frequency of minor unintentional injuries in children at home, and larger trials are required to assess the effect on more severe injuries. Future programs should target a few, well-focused, evidence-based areas including the evaluation of high-risk groups and the effect of repeated visits on outcome. Although equipment was provided and fitted free of charge, the observed changes in safety practices may not have been large enough to affect injury rates. We have no evidence that the coordinated intervention programs reduced the other target injuries--although exposure to prevention messages was associated with safety behaviors for burns and poisonings."
143,CD010611,"Extended-release divalproex sodium is an efficacious, well-tolerated, safe, and easy-to-use once-a-day prophylactic antimigraine medication. These results suggest that both drugs are effective and safe in migraine prophylaxis. This effect of topiramate and sodium valporate has previously been shown to reduce migraine headache, and we postulate that treatment with topiramate and sodium valporate may have a similar benefit. We conclude that sodium valproate is an effective and well-tolerated prophylactic medication for migraine without aura. In general, the drug was well tolerated and proved to be an effective treatment in migraine. Topiramate dose of 50 mg/day with fewer side effects in comparison with its higher doses may be an appropriate substitution for first-line migraine prophylaxis such as valproate. Divalproex sodium is an effective prophylactic treatment in migraine and is generally well tolerated. Divalproex is an effective prophylactic drug for patients with migraine headaches and is generally well tolerated. No significant difference was identified between divalproex and propranolol for the prophylaxis of migraine without aura. Due to the lack of additional benefit from higher valproic acid doses (more than 600 mg per day), we recommend daily valproic acid doses of 500 to 600 mg with a target serum level less than 50 microg/mL for the prophylactic treatment of migraine."

The presence of thyroid remnants smaller than 1 ml at US evaluation had no effect on the ablation rate. Therapeutic (131)I activities of 1850 MBq are equally effective as 3700 MBq for thyroid ablation in DTC patients prepared with rhTSH, even in the presence of node metastases. On the other hand their red-marrow absorbed dose seems to be lower."
145,CD005129,"For economic as well as efficacy reasons, we recommended that IVIG preparations not be used routinely with antilymphocyte therapy but only in high-risk situations such as primary CMV exposure. A larger randomized study is needed to substantiate these results. Polyimmune gammaglobulin prophylaxis should be considered in transplant patients with previous CMV exposure who will be receiving prolonged anti-T-cell therapy because of acute rejection or primary nonfunction. This therapy should be considered for renal transplant recipients who are at high risk for developing CMV infection, both primary and secondary. Though the clinical manifestation of the disease is lowered by HIS in cyclosporin-treated patients, there is a higher infection incidence with increased severity in HIS-treated ATG/Imurek patients compared to the respective control. Since short-term prophylaxis with ganciclovir may delay the onset of CMV disease, further studies with a longer course of ganciclovir prophylaxis are warranted. We conclude, that low-dose rIFNa2C prophylaxis is harmful in renal allograft recipients treated with cyclosporine in view of the high incidence of irreversible transplant rejections without beneficial effects on the occurrence of viral infections. In contrast, antithymocyte globulin appears to increase the severity of infection from cytomegalovirus among these patients. Prophylaxis with CMV-IGIV alone did not decrease CMV viremia or pneumonitis, did not decrease the incidence of acute rejection or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, and did not affect 1-year survival of CMV-seropositive lung transplant recipients at our center. Thus, prior immunization rendered seronegative patients more resistant to the effects of CMV infection. No adverse effects were found in the CMV immunoglobulin group, but 19% of the patients in the ganciclovir group developed mild leukopenia or a mild increase in their serum creatinine levels. These data suggest that prophylactic ganciclovir therapy provides a cost-effective approach toward significantly improving the outcome of renal transplantation in recipients at risk for primary CMV disease. It is concluded from these results that prophylaxis with CMV hyperimmunoglobulin should be undertaken either selectively or for shorter periods than those chosen for the reported trial. The incidence of rejection and graft loss was not different between the two groups. Therefore passive immunization should be restricted to seronegative recipients of seropositive allograft donors treated for rejection. Our findings indicate that CMV transmission or reactivation may best be prevented by long-term antiviral agent administration, and that the primary morbidity of CMV disease is the need for rehospitalization when either prolonged ACV or short-duration GCV + HIg prophylaxis is used in this patient population. We conclude that CMV immune globulin provides effective prophylaxis in renal-transplant recipients at risk for primary CMV disease. In seropositive renal-transplant recipients, interferon-alpha affords effective prophylaxis against serious cytomegalovirus infections. Vaccine-treated patients who received kidneys from seronegative donors did not excrete virus, and therefore the vaccine virus was not reactivated from a putative latent state despite immunosuppression at the time of transplantation. The only effect that was seen was on the time from transplantation to detection of active CMV infection, which was prolonged by HIg prophylaxis. D+/R-. Given the ready availability of ganciclovir to treat CMV disease, we recommend a reappraisal of the role of CMV prophylaxis by these means in the solid organ transplant population. However, this investigation suggests that the routine, prophylactic administration of polyvalent IgG, to prevent or to ameliorate CMV infection in unselected cadaver renal transplant recipients, is not warranted."
146,CD007693,"Breast-feeding for 6 months or more may protect children from developing dental fluorosis in the permanent incisors. However, the prevalence of 'Very Mild' fluorosis was twice as frequent in Dublin than in Freiburg. Parents should supervise young children as they brush their teeth with fluoride dentifrice. The prevalence of dental fluorosis was not explained by the risk factors, including fluoride toothpaste usage as explored in this study. High fluoride (1,450 ppm F) toothpastes should not be provided on a community basis to very young children in less deprived communities. Adherence to the guidelines published by the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry is recommended. Copyright 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel There was no significant difference in the prevalence of caries in either primary or permanent teeth although the trend in both cases was for slightly more disease in children who had used the test paste. Respectively similar associations were observed between mild-to-moderate enamel fluorosis on later forming (FRI classification II) enamel surfaces and frequent brushing and fluoride supplement use, but not with infant formula use. Infant formula was not found to be associated with fluorosis on either FRI classification I or II surfaces. Results suggest that children in the four communities may be ingesting a similar level of F from sources such as dentifrices, dietary supplements, and professional applications, but the factor that differentiates them with respect to the prevalence of caries and fluorosis is the F concentration in the community water supply. No association was observed between the use of ready to feed infant formula and enamel fluorosis. Results suggest that toothpaste use in children two years of age and younger should be cautious, limited to follow current guidelines, and supervised by parents to minimize the risk of dental fluorosis. Because the teeth examined in this study were at risk of fluorosis in 1992-95, very soon after policies changed, and because people are slow to change health habits, it seems reasonable to expect a further improvement when teeth mineralised in the late 1990s become visible. Risk factors for fluorosis were use of toothpaste before the age of 14 months and regular use of fluoride supplements during childhood. There was no association between behavior problems and dental fluorosis in this population. The decline was mainly linked with the reduction in exposure to fluoride from fluoridated toothpaste. Fluoride toothpaste use before the age of 6 years is a risk indicator for fluorosis in this study population. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The results suggest prudent use of dentifrice by young children to minimize the risk of fluorosis. The results of the cross-sectional surveys conducted with schoolchildren in 1991, 1995, and 1997 suggest a continuing decrease in the prevalence of dental caries and an increase in the prevalence of dental fluorosis in this nonfluoridated Brazilian town. Dental fluorosis is not a public health problem in East York, but parents should be advised to supervise toothbrushing by children under 2 years of age. An odds ratio of 1.7 associated with infant formula use was suggestive of an increased risk of enamel fluorosis as was an odds ratio of 2.9 associated with fluoride dentifrice use. Copyright 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel The results of the study suggest that toothpaste swallowing may be a factor in the production of fluorosis."
147,CD004487,"The most important finding was the statistically significantly shorter period until the onset of the action of paracetamol as against acetyl salicylic acid. The tolerability for the active drugs was comparable to that for placebo. We concluded that codeine 60 mg added to acetaminophen 1000 mg offers analgesic advantages, and acetaminophen reaches an analgesic ceiling effect at 1000 mg using the dental pain model. Thus naproxen sodium demonstrated superior efficacy and similar tolerability to acetaminophen in this postoperative dental pain model. These treatments provide up to 4 h of pain relief after this surgical procedure. All adverse effects were transitory and consistent with the known pharmacologic profiles of the study medications or the backup analgesic. All treatments were generally well tolerated. The findings from this study showed that soluble aspirin 900 mg provides significant and more rapid analgesia than paracetamol 1,000 mg in the early postoperative period after third molar surgery. The results of this study indicate that flurbiprofen is more effective and causes fewer effects than acetaminophen and codeine when used for post-operative dental pain, in ambulatory patients. Most patients needed only 1-tablet doses following the initial 2-tablet dose. (R)- Ketoprofen possesses analgesic activity and an acceptable side-effect profile in the oral surgery pain model. The frequency of adverse effects was similar for the active medications. No serious adverse effects were reported in this single-dose study. Ibuprofen liquigel provided greater peak and overall analgesic effects and a more rapid onset to analgesia than did acetaminophen 1000 mg. A positive dose-effect relationship was evident for both acetaminophen 500 mg. and 1,000 mg. and for oxycodone 5 mg. and 10 mg. Both opioid-analgesic combinations showed small additive effects over acetaminophen alone, and indoprofen was superior to both combination treatments and acetaminophen alone. The frequency of adverse effects was similar for the active medications. There were no adverse effects with flurbiprofen or zomepirac. In conclusion, effervescent acetaminophen produces a significantly faster onset of analgesia than tablet acetaminophen."
148,CD008388,"The results suggest that the academic disorders found in right brain damage can be treated as secondary to a primary disturbance in visual scanning behavior. A free Web-based version of the therapy used in this study is available online to suitable patients with HA. The authors propose that top-down signals preactivate partially damaged areas of V1, thus linking visual and attentional neuronal networks, with the effect of permanently increasing conscious visual perception. Analyses revealed that the performance of those in the experimental group exceeded that of the controls, that those patients in the experimental group with severe impairments improved more than those with mild impairments, and that combined multiple-treatment produces greater generalization than the original single treatment program. However, given the evidence of increased risk of accidents for patients with peripheral vision loss, the safety of peripheral enhancement devices for driving must be thoroughly evaluated before their impact on public safety is known. The improvements in trained as well as in untrained areas are explained by top-down attentional control mechanisms interacting with local visual cortex plasticity. The implications of this type of treatment program are discussed. These pathways bypass the damaged visual cortex, stimulating extrastriate cortical regions, and are thought to be involved in blindsight. In conclusion, VRT with a computer program improves vision in patients with visual-field defects and offers a new, cost-effective therapy for partial blindness. The findings show substantial benefits of compensatory exploration training, including subjective improvements in mastering daily-life activities, in a randomized controlled trial."

150,CD000168,"We conclude that traction should not be administered routinely to patients awaiting operation for hip fracture. Increased attention to analgesic medication and rapid handling to be operated are of importance to promote the rehabilitation process. The application of skin traction to patients with fractures of the upper femur is time-consuming and we recommend therefore that its routine use should be discontinued. The application of skin traction offered no benefits, and thus routine use of preoperative skin traction in patients with hip fractures is not recommended. However, an external device, such as a skin traction kit without weight, may be used in patients with persistent pain; this external device may have an additive placebo effect, as was proven in this study. The conclusion was that skin traction offered no benefits in pain control for the patient and therefore should not be used routinely. No other objective benefit can be shown from using skin traction, and its routine use should be abandoned. The authors think that preoperative skin traction in patients with hip fractures does not provide significant pain relief, as compared with pillow placement under the injured extremity, and thus should not be routinely performed in this patient population for analgesia. Since half of the patients found the application of skeletal traction painful, compared to one fifth with skin traction, skeletal traction should not be routinely used to alleviate pain preoperatively in these patients."
151,CD002855,"There was no difference in efficacy or side effects whether the prostaglandin was administered 24 or 48 hours after mifepristone intake, which suggests that the treatment period can be reduced from the conventional 48 hours. Regimens with repeated dosing of misoprostol 800 microg pv warrant further study to find the optimal treatment protocol. No differences in efficacy were observed when amenorrhoea length was < 57 days. 2000;284:1948-1953. The prevalence of prostaglandin-related side effects, however, was higher with this route of administration. After treatment with mifepristone 600 mg, administration of misoprostol 400 microg orally on the same day is not as effective at causing abortion within the first 24 hours compared with the standard time interval of 48 hours between medications. (i) Both regimens using a reduced dose of mifepristone are highly effective methods of inducing abortion in early pregnancy; (ii) vaginal misoprostol is the preferred prostaglandin because it is it is associated with fewer failures than low-dose gemeprost, particularly at gestation > or =49 days. We conclude: (i) that the recommended dose of mifepristone could be reduced from 600 to 200 mg without loss of clinical efficacy, (ii) that the combination of mifepristone and 600 micrograms misoprostol is a highly effective alternative to vacuum aspiration for inducing abortion in women < 50 days amenorrhoea and (iii) at gestation > 56 days, this combination may result in too many incomplete abortions to be clinically acceptable. Tamoxifen does not appear to have any benefits over methotrexate. Oral mifepristone 200 mg followed by vaginal misoprostol 800 micrograms after 6 hours is not as effective at achieving a complete abortion compared with the 36- to 48-hour protocol. There was no significant difference in side effects between the four treatment groups. There appears to be a range of safe and effective options for early medical abortion with mifepristone including a choice between oral and vaginal administration of misoprostol. Conclusion While an additional oral dose of 400 microgram misoprostol did not significantly increase the rate of complete abortion without surgical intervention, the additional dose did significantly reduce the rate of continuing pregnancies without compromising the acceptability and ease of use of the method. These data suggest that pretreatment with tamoxifen is not necessary when using moistened vaginal misoprostol for abortion of pregnancies of </=56 days of gestation. Both the 100 and 200 mg doses of mifepristone and the 24- and 48-hour intervals have a similar efficacy to achieve complete abortion in early pregnancy when mifepristone is followed by 800 micrograms of vaginally administered misoprostol. With 12-h intervals, vaginal route should be used, whereas with 3-h intervals either route could be chosen. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The 88% efficacy obtained with vaginal misoprostol alone may be clinically acceptable when mifepristone is not available. It is concluded that the combination of RU486 and a single PG vaginal pessary is a highly effective means of inducing therapeutic abortion in early pregnancy and offers an alternative to surgery. This treatment regimen may offer an alternative to surgical abortion or the use of antiprogestins and prostaglandin for medical abortion. The sublingual route appears superior to the regimen of 400 mcg misoprostol used orally and may be a good option for mifepristone medical abortion. After the administration of mifepristone, vaginal administration of misoprostol is more effective and better tolerated than oral administration for the induction of first-trimester abortion. The regimens of 600 mg or 200 mg of mifepristone, followed by a single oral dose of misoprostol 400 microg 48 hours later, were not sufficiently efficient in inducing abortion when the menstrual delay was > 21 days. The ongoing pregnancy rate was higher than previously reported with vaginal or parenteral administration of prostaglandin. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to assess whether the complete abortion rate can be improved with this regimen. Methotrexate 50 mg/m2 intramuscularly has the same clearance rates when administered during pregnancy as in a nonpregnant state, and maximum concentrations do not reach sustained toxic levels. Further randomized trials are required to find out the optimal dose of sublingual misoprostol that can give the highest complete abortion rate and lowest incidence of side-effects. Mifepristone taken 300 mg plus misoprostol 1,200 micrograms orally for 6 days is an optimal dose regimen for termination of early pregnancy. Low-dose mifepristone (100 mg) combined with vaginal misoprostol 800 microg may be an effective alternative to regimens using 200 or 600 mg of mifepristone with misoprostol. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00269568 I. This combination may offer an alternative to the use of antiprogestin and prostaglandin for medical abortion. Women receiving mifepristone and vaginal misoprostol for abortion can have the flexibility to administer the misoprostol as soon as 6 hours after using the mifepristone. Should a need arise, a majority of women would choose medical abortion again and would prefer to have it at a health facility rather than at home. Our results indicate that 75 mg mifepristone in capsule form combined with 600 microg misoprostol is as effective and safe as 150 mg mifepristone in tablet form for the termination of pregnancy up to 49 days. The treatment was well tolerated by the women and except for one woman who experienced a profound bleeding necessitating a blood transfusion, no serious side effects were seen. The combination of methotrexate and misoprostol is a more effective abortifacient regimen than when either drug is used alone. Oral methotrexate may be an effective alternative to intramuscular methotrexate in treatment regimens for nonsurgical abortion. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00386867 I. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Thus oral PGE2, when given in clinically acceptable doses, is not a suitable alternative to synthetic PGE analogues for use in combination with RU 486 for termination of early pregnancy. When used for early pregnancy termination with prostaglandin, a lower dose of mifepristone than the currently recommended single 600-mg dose may suffice. Buccal administration of misoprostol after low-dose mifepristone for medical abortion appears to be a highly effective and acceptable alternative compared with vaginal administration for medical abortion in pregnancies through 56 days LMP. This study confirmed the effectiveness of mifepristone and prostaglandin for the induction of early abortion but suggests that more research should be carried out to determine the lowest effective doses of both drugs. The use of methotrexate and misoprostol together could be an alternative to the intramuscular use of methotrexate or the use of antiprogestins and prostaglandin for medical abortion. Besides, it has advantages of convenience of use, less side effects, easy storage and transfer, and low cost. When used after methotrexate for early abortion, the vaginal route for misoprostol is more effective and preferred to the buccal route. This study indicates that for medical abortions induced with methotrexate and misoprostol it is possible to offer both the oral and injected routes of methotrexate without sacrificing efficacy and that about half of the women offered a choice will choose the oral route. The trial demonstrated that although two doses of oral misoprostol were effective, the vaginal misoprostol was more effective at inducing an early medical abortion at 1 day after low-dose mifepristone, and the regimen could be extended to 63 days gestation."
152,CD004740,"Hydrocortisone acetate combined with the antibiotics improved individual symptoms better as did the steroid-free ointment. The bacteriological findings and treatment responses do not differ between adults and children. 7 days treatment with CIP/DEX otic suspension administered twice daily is clinically and microbiologically superior to N/P/H otic suspension administered 3 times daily in the treatment of mild to severe AOE, and is equally well tolerated. The two treatments provide rapid and comparable pain relief; however, ofloxacin otic solution does not have the risk of ototoxicity associated with neomycin and provides effective pain relief without adjunctive steroids. Because of its endogenous nature and its higher efficacy, NCT appears to be a good choice for topical treatment of acute otitis externa. It especially leads to an overall reduction of symptoms in cases of moderately or more severe otitis externa and cases lasting for more than 2 days. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that the glycerin formulation of ototopical 0.3% ciprofloxacin appears to be at least as effective as the aqueous form in the treatment of acute external otitis--and in the case of otorrhea, more so. However, low systemic exposure, absence of ototoxicity, and less frequent dosing clearly favor Cipro HC. Larger numbers of infected mastoid cavities are required to be studied. From this study it would appear that antibiotic-based drops confer no real advantage over boric acid in spirit. Therefore, it is recommended that GI dressing can be used instead of an antibiotic dressing as an initial treatment of severe acute otitis externa on the basis of cost, avoidance of resistance and toxicity. Therefore, ciprofloxacillin is at least as effective as gentamicin in such ear infections and has no potential ototoxic effect. The study suggests that an aminoglycoside antibiotic conveys no significant benefit in this condition. Overall, these results support greater pain relief attained over the first 3 d in patients with acute otitis externa treated with CIP/DEX compared with NPH and a rapid reduction in severe pain after initiation of treatment. Steroid and acetic acid or steroid and antibiotic ear drops are equally effective. Additionally, previous episodes of external otitis or other skin diseases did not seem to influence any treatment given."
153,CD004884,"The frequency of extra-neurological infections and of asymptomatic pulmonary bacterial colonization was similar in both groups, but frequency of asymptomatic bacteriuria was higher in the placebo-treated patients. The results of the study suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis has a role in the management of open and basilar fractures. Further studies in this area are warranted. It is suggested that a more rational approach to the treatment of basilar skull fractures includes close observation of the patient for early signs of meningitis, and if these should develop, treatment with antibiotics appropriate to the organism involved."
154,CD002891,"Our experiences in implementing health promotion lessons that conveyed knowledge about eating disorders and addressed physical and psychological issues in a more general way indicated that these interventions can be carried out in schools, and may contribute to increases in physical and psychological well-being in a high-risk population of adolescents. Although more intensive interventions seem necessary to modify shape and weight concern and self-esteem, these findings suggest that the intervention had been useful since it led to both an increase in knowledge and a decrease in some dysfunctional eating attitudes. Rather than targeting the entire population, a healthy weight curriculum designed to modify the eating attitudes and unhealthful weight regulation practices of young adolescent girls might better focus on "at risk" students. Copyright 2002 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. However, for high-risk subjects more intensive and specific intervention may be required, for which further research is needed.

155,CD001694,"These data suggested that aerosolized furosemide improved pulmonary function in infants with chronic lung disease without excessive diuresis. Doses of 1 mg/kg significantly improved lung compliance (51% at 2 hours after nebulization), pulmonary resistance (28% at 1 hour), and tidal volume (43% at 1 hour), starting as early as 30 minutes after the dose; the effect lasted for at least 4 hours in many of the infants and was not associated with diuresis or renal side effects. We conclude that, under the conditions of our study, a single dose of 1 mg/kg inhaled furosemide does not improve the pulmonary mechanics in ventilator-dependent infants with severe BPD. The pulmonary effects of nebulized furosemide are independent of its diuretic action. Single dose nebulised frusemide improves pulmonary function in premature infants with evolving chronic lung disease without adverse effects on fluid and electrolyte balance."
156,CD006660,"Practical problems associated with administering an SBD regimen to patients awaiting cadaver liver transplants limit the regimen's usefulness, but we found a trend toward reduced key site infection when the regimen was given > or = 3 days before transplantation. No serious adverse events were attributed to G-CSF. Infections with Gram-negative bacilli and with Candida species are replaced by infections with Gram-positive cocci. Routine use of SBD in patients undergoing liver transplantation is not associated with significant benefit. The failure of selective decontamination to enhance survival rates in many studies of the regimen in critically ill patients may, in part, be related to the inability of selective decontamination to abolish endotoxemia. Treatment with only fibers led to a low incidence of severe infections."

In conclusion, we feel that the efficacy, and the few side-effects of these drugs used alone and particularly when used in sequential combination, make them a very attractive treatment for advanced endometrial adenocarcinoma.

162,CD006715,"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) These results do suggest that mechanisms other than an improved splanchnic blood flow by DPX and EPI treatment have to be considered for the anti-inflammatory effects. Thoracic epidural analgesia yields a slight, but significant, improvement in pulmonary function, most likely due to a more profound postoperative analgesia. Thoracic epidural anesthesia does not provide any additional benefits in terms of reducing myocardial damage, inflammatory, and stress response compared with general anesthesia only in patients undergoing OPCABG surgery. The exact clinical relevance of this finding remains unclear. The subcutaneous interstitial tissue could be less expanded postoperatively in the TEA-group, also reflected by a lower increase in Pif. This method of analgesia was also associated with minimal side effects and provides an alternate approach for treatment of pain after cardiac operations. These effects of high TEA may improve the long-term outcome after myocardial revascularization. Finally, SAP is not an acute-phase protein in men. Thus, perioperative epidural anesthesia/analgesia combined with postoperative epidural anesthesia/analgesia was not protective against hypoxemia, and therapy with opioids did not seem to be of importance for the occurrence of late postoperative hypoxemia on nights 2 and 3 after CABG surgery. It is concluded that intraoperative and postoperative pain treatment with epidurally administered bupivacaine plus sufentanil improved the recovery time, as well as pulmonary and cardiac outcome after CABG, when compared with IV postoperative pain treatment after intraoperative GA with sufentanil and midazolam. These data allows appropriate power calculations for further, large-scale studies to determine the anaesthetic technique that provides optimal myocardial protection. All rights reserved. High thoracic epidural blockade with 5-10 ml of 0.3% ropivacaine increases myocardial oxygen availability in coronary diseased patients prior to surgical revascularization without deleterious hemodynamic disturbances. This is associated with decreased myocardial ischemia as determined by less release of troponin T. These findings may have an impact on the anesthetic management for coronary artery bypass grafting. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. The result of the present study indicate that TEA plus GA in coronary surgery had preserved cardiac function during intraoperative and postoperative period by means of reduced apoptosis, improved hemodynamic function and reduced arrhythmias after release of the ACC. In elective cardiac surgery, thoracic epidural analgesia combined with general anesthesia followed by patient-controlled thoracic epidural analgesia offers no major advantage with respect to hospital length of stay, quality of recovery, or morbidity when compared with general anesthesia alone followed by to patient-controlled analgesia with intravenous morphine. The potential risks of thoracic epidural anesthesia during off-pump coronary artery bypass procedures should not be underestimated. Epidural analgesia reduces pain after coronary operation and is associated with improved physiotherapy cooperation, earlier extubation, and reduced risk of depression and posttraumatic stress. We conclude that TEA attenuates the surgically mediated sympathetic stress response to sternotomy, thereby preventing the increase in myocardial oxygen demand in the pre-bypass period without jeopardizing myocardial perfusion. All rights reserved. Given the potentially devastating complications of an epidural hematoma after insertion of an epidural catheter, it is questionable whether this procedure should be applied routinely in cardiac surgical patients who require full heparinization. We conclude that HTEA for CABG surgery had no effect on troponin release but improved postoperative analgesia and was associated with a reduced time to extubation. In patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, the addition of thoracic epidural to general anesthesia significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative arrhythmias and improves pain control and overall quality of recovery, allowing earlier extubation and hospital discharge. The benefits of this technique in terms of a reduction in postoperative morbidity remain to be determined. Epidural anesthesia also allowed earlier weaning from mechanical ventilation, but it did not affect hospital discharge time. TEA can reduce respirator time and the need for morphine analgesics after CABG without negative effects on VA/Q matching, oxygenation, or atelectasis formation. We conclude that continuous TEA significantly improves the quality of recovery after coronary artery bypass graft surgery compared with conventional narcotic analgesia. The use of TEA resulted in better analgesia, early tracheal extubation and shorter ICU stay and should be considered for obese patients undergoing OPCAB. The perioperative amiodarone regimen used in this study was effective in reducing the incidence of AF after CABG while TEA was not."

B breve can colonise the immature bowel very effectively and is associated with fewer abnormal abdominal signs and better weight gain in VLBW infants, probably as a result of stabilisation of their intestinal flora and accelerated feeding schedules. The results of the present study suggest that very early administration of B. breve to low birth weight infants is useful in promoting the colonization of the Bifidobacterium and the formation of a normal intestinal flora. However, the probiotic supplementation increased the cell counts of bifidobacteria and reduced the cell counts of enterobacteria and clostridia. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved An SB-supplemented formula is well tolerated by preterm infants, it has a beneficial effect on stool flora bringing it closer to that of breast fed babies but it does not improve D-xylose or lipid gut absorption.

These results suggest that facultative gram-negative enteric bacterial colonization, with either total or aminoglycoside-resistant strains, is not decreased by oral feedings of Lactobacillus acidophilus in premature infants.

Probiotics, in the form of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, fed enterally to very low birth weight preterm infants for 6 weeks reduced the incidence of death or necrotizing enterocolitis. However, colonisation with Lactobacillus GG did not reduce the faecal reservoir of potential pathogens and there was no evidence that colonisation had any positive clinical benefit for this particular group of infants.

167,CD003940,"The lower response rate in the patients who received itraconazole 100 mg daily for 7 days could be explained by drug interactions and the unpredictable absorption of itraconazole. Future studies are needed to define the optimal regimen for both the treatment and prevention of recurrent oral candidiasis in HIV-infected patients, addressing special attention to the issue of compliance, cost, and emergence of resistance. D0870 demonstrates excellent efficacy at low doses in the treatment of HIV-related OPC and exhibits a favourable safety profile. Caspofungin provided a generally well-tolerated parenteral therapeutic option for HIV-infected patients with oropharyngeal and/or esophageal candidiasis in this study. Primary prophylaxis with itraconazole capsules prevents histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis in patients with HIV infection. In conclusion, systemic therapy with intraconazole oral solution is efficacious and well tolerated in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV/AIDS, when administered once daily for 14 days for the treatment of oral candidiasis. Data were analyzed using the chi-squared test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Student's t-test. However, posaconazole was more effective in sustaining clinical success after treatment was stopped. Though the patient population was small, the use of lemon juice and lemon grass for the treatment of oral candidiasis in an HIV population was validated by the randomised controlled trial. It provides the first and only once-daily topical treatment option and should therefore be considered in first-line therapy for this condition, particularly in resource-poor settings, where ease of use can help to guarantee the success of therapy. This regimen has a useful role in the management of HIV-infected women who are at risk for recurrent mucosal candidiasis. Patients with CD4 counts < 200 who are carriers of C. albicans and have a history of oral candidiasis may be most likely to benefit from antifungal prophylaxis. Itraconazole oral solution is well tolerated and offers an alternative at least as effective as fluconazole in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Both formulations of the melaleuca oral solution appear to be effective alternative regimens for patients with AIDS suffering from oropharyngeal candidiasis refractory to fluconazole. Development of resistant candidiasis (clinical and/or microbiological) was rarely seen in either group and its incidence was not significantly different. These results show that, in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, itraconazole oral solution and fluconazole capsules at a 100-mg single daily dose for 14 days are equally effective. The avoidance of multiple-per-day dosing would appear to favor fluconazole. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Despite successful clinical and mycological clearance, 80% patients had a further episode of candidosis within the next 3 months. Larger trials to confirm prevention of all mycoses with prophylaxis should be considered. Fluconazole seemed more effective than ketoconazole in the treatment of oral thrush among AIDS and ARC patients. Further study should be performed to better assess the size of the effect, or to confirm our findings. Follow-up examinations 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment showed a comparably high rate of relapse in both patient groups. Itraconazole is marginally more efficacious than ketoconazole in the treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis in HIV-positive patients and both drugs appear safe and well tolerated. Resistance occurred with both continuous and intermittent therapy; however, therapeutic responses were excellent. Fluconazole was well tolerated and prevented clinical relapse of oropharyngeal candidiasis in 71% of patients who completed three months of treatment (95% confidence interval [CI], 55-86) and 58% (95% CI, 41-75) who completed six months of treatment. Continuous fluconazole therapy is not associated with significant risk of fluconazole-refractory OPC or EC, compared with episodic fluconazole therapy, in HIV-infected patients with access to active antiretroviral therapy. Fluconazole oral suspension as a systemic therapy was more effective than liquid nystatin as a topical therapy in the treatment of oral candidiasis in HIV-infected patients and provided a longer disease-free interval before relapse. Fluconazole 150 mg once weekly was found to be effective in maintaining patients both clinically and mycologically free of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Its efficacy is similar to that of conventional amphotericin. As it is very cheap (0.5 US$/treatment course in Kinshasa), we suggest that its use should be assessed in larger studies."
168,CD002280,"These findings suggest that the efficacy of APF gel applications without previous prophylaxis varies according to the individual risk of the subjects and that more comprehensive programs should be targeted to very high-risk children. Thus, professional flossing with NaF or SnF2 gel carried out 4 times a year may be considered as an interesting caries-preventing method for large-scale application in schoolchildren. In order to maintain a positive effect of fluoride over an extended time period, caries-prone subjects should continue an initiated fluoride programme. However, when the data were examined for effects of DMFS for specific tooth surface, significant restriction (61%) of occlusal increment was shown in the group which was treated with amine fluoride daily for 5 consecutive days as compared with the control group. Frequent, but less than daily, topical fluoride therapy appeared to have little effect in pre-school children consuming water-borne fluoride and receiving other traditionally recommended modalities of prevention."
169,CD000409,"Improved teamwork among caregivers can improve prescribing as defined by clinical guidelines. Ethnic groups may not benefit equally from specialist nurse intervention. Practices where primary care teams received an educational outreach visit demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in uptake in high-risk groups for pneumococcal but not influenza vaccine. An educational program targeted to physicians, nurses, and aides can reduce the use of psychoactive drugs in nursing homes without adversely affecting the overall behavior and level of functioning of the residents. Detailed and prolonged development and testing of behavioural interventions is an essential first step before embarking on randomized controlled trials which involve complex behavioural changes in professionals or patients. are a cost-effective technique for reducing physicians' prescribing costs, and are superior to peer-comparison feedback. Future efforts to promote judicious prescribing should continue to build on growing public awareness of antibiotic overuse. Clinical guidelines implemented with workshops and educational outreach visits improved some but not all aspects of prescribing in the short-term. Retrospective diagnosis may also have obscured a real intervention effect. General practitioners may have considerable public health impact in promotion of health for elderly patients. The project highlights challenges of delivering evidence based care in a setting in which there is a paucity of well controlled trial evidence but where significant health outcomes can be attained. Modification of physicians' tetracycline prescribing behavior was achieved in an actual practice setting by personal visits from peer physicians. There was a decrease in the average prescribing cost of pounds 6.60 per doctor per month in the intervention group compared with the reference group. However, we predict modest savings over a 2-y period. Educational interventions may have to be targeted to specific areas of the practice, with physicians being monitored and receiving ongoing feedback on their performance. A targeted outreach program may improve high-quality reporting of ADRs among physicians. An increase in referral to physiotherapy or educational programmes followed the provision of a triage service. The effectiveness of future interventions may be improved by focusing on patients whose blood pressure is uncontrolled at baseline. However, improving processes of care may not always translate into improvement of specific outcomes. Educational facilitators and volunteer couriers do not seem to be cost effective strategies for distributing smoking interventions. Further work is required to develop effective means to influence prescribing in line with independent guidelines especially in the context of the development of Primary Care Groups. Implementation of evidence-based recommendations improved the provision of nutritional support and was associated with improved clinical outcomes. "Academic group detailing" by pharmacists to primary care doctors can be an effective method for influencing prescribing practices. The reminder-feedback plus educational outreach intervention significantly increased CDE recommendation and performance. Change after mutual practice visits and feedback by peers is more marked than after a visit and feedback by a non-physician observer. A clinic-based program incorporating physician education, provider prompts, patient education materials, and appointment reminders and emphasizing nursing involvement can facilitate adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines among inner-city women. Practice-based training plus support telephone calls was the most effective and cost-effective strategy to encourage implementation of SBI by GPs. Mailed educational materials combined with an office visit by a simulated patient instructor for role-play and feedback on clinical performance increased the frequency of office-based physicians' risk assessment and risk reduction counseling of patients for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV infection. The effectiveness of such a program in other settings requires further study. Patient care appraisal is an effective tool in continuing medical education and leads to improvement in the quality of care, provided the process focuses on essential criteria of care. One-to-one educational meetings improved the prescribing of antiulcer agents for outpatients in an HMO. Face-to-face visits proved the most successful of the two methods to influence GP prescribing, although the workbook promoted more change than that seen in the control group. The tailored multifaceted intervention delivered by nurse facilitators was effective in modifying physician practice patterns and significantly improved preventive care performance. Although the small group face-to-face intervention did not appear to offer greater impacts over large seminars in improving the appropriate use of drugs in acute diarrhoea, since the unit cost of training is far less costly than the seminar, it might be feasibly implemented in the existing supervisory structure of the health system. The results show a favorable impact of personalized information in the groups with high prescription volume, which is particularly remarkable in the highest prescribers. Both the validity and the opinion about feasibility of the guideline in daily practice deserve more attention during guideline development. Both group and individual academic detailing improved antihypertensive prescribing over and above usual care but may require reinforcement to sustain improvements. We found no effect of academic detailing as a single intervention. More data are needed regarding the durability of changes in practice patterns and the health and economic benefits of such interventions. The routine use of untargeted outreach visiting is probably not a worthwhile strategy. Results also show that the effectiveness of these interventions increases when presented together with written material. Primary care practices that use electronic medical records and receive regular performance reports can improve their adherence to clinical practice guidelines for cardiovascular disease and stroke prevention. This study provides evidence that the use of specialist nurses to perform educational outreach to improve target adherence to patients with diabetes in primary care is not effective. Greater understanding of the underlying processes in improving performance within multidisciplinary teams through further, theory-driven studies with "no intervention" control groups and longer follow-up are needed. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Promoting organizational change to produce sustained improvement in preventive service clinical outcomes is a complex process that requires further research. A follow-up survey conducted 4 weeks after the intervention showed that the oral information campaign positively affected physicians' attitudes about the value of oral drug information from an industry-independent source. The effect is small and the strategy needs further development. Future research is needed to evaluate the effect of physician counseling on the weight and physical activity level of their patients. A multifaceted intervention using algorithms can reduce the number of antimicrobial prescriptions for suspected urinary tract infections in residents of nursing homes. A marked decrease in benzodiazepine prescribing was seen over the course of the study in both intervention and control groups but no differential effect due to the educational outreach visit was found. The positive effects and cost-effectiveness of such programmes need to be tested over a longer period for other health problems and in other countries. The educational package positively influenced referral for menorrhagia and treatment with appropriate non-hormonal drugs. Further development is required if cost effective management of asthma is to be introduced. Targeted one-on-one education is a practical, effective, and safe method for reducing excessive broad-spectrum antibiotic use. There is good evidence to support the use of educational outreach visits in small practices. Clinical practice in this area is receptive to evidence-based interventions. The lack of agreement between patient reports and medical records review raises concerns about current methods of ascertaining compliance with guidelines for preventive care. The use of simple prompts may enhance this improvement. Preconceptional carrier screening and counselling need to be coupled with antenatal screening. Although good prescribing at baseline in the participating practices limited the capacity for improvement, this trial provides no evidence that guidelines with or without educational outreach visits from community pharmacists lead to substantial improvements in prescribing behaviour. Further research is needed to identify barriers to guideline implementation and evidence-based practice in this setting. While the use of other effective cessation strategies appeared to increase, a larger trial is needed for further evaluation. Application of the scheme on a nationwide basis could not only improve prescriber choice of the most appropriate antibiotic but also result in a significant saving of health care dollars. Further work is needed to define cost effective methods to enhance the uptake of evidence from systematic reviews and to clarify leadership and roles of senior obstetric staff in implementing the evidence. Further research efforts should be devoted to cost-effectiveness studies of such interventions."

172,CD006386,"According to our experience we recommend the use of cisplatin in conjunction with neck radiotherapy. The main toxic features were acute mucositis, pneumonitis and dermatitis. There was no significant difference between the sites of recurrence at death or last follow-up (P = .38). C-HART (70.6 Gy) is superior to dose-escalated HART (77.6 Gy) with comparable or less acute reactions and equivalent late reactions, indicating an improvement of the therapeutic ratio. Results are discussed taking into account a review of literature. Thus this schedule of oral Etoposide does not seem to increase either the efficacy or the toxicity of DDP. In our experience the radio-chemotherapy combination, according to the described schedules, failed to improve both local control and overall survival; the comparison with the control group does not suggest that induction or intercalated chemotherapy can increase long-term survival even if initial complete and partial response rates are high. Phase III studies are needed in order to establish the superiority of this combination of cisplatin and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. The study did not show any major influence of MMC on loco-regional tumour control, survival or morbidity after primary radiotherapy in stage III-IV head and neck cancer except in N0 patients where loco-regional control was significantly improved. The appearance of the chronical complications such as the osteoradionecrosis of the mandible and the cataract of the lens could be prevented by the use of bleomycin or BUdR combined with radiotherapy. However, toxicity was more common in patients treated with the two modalities of combined treatment and there were no differences in overall survival rates (P = 0.706). Stratification of the results on the type of local treatment, surgery plus radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone, did not reveal any heterogeneity in the effect of chemotherapy. Some patients with local treatment failure were surgically salvaged. The rates of complete tumor resorption were: group A--27.3%, group B--19.2% and group C--16.7%. As compared with Hfx RT alone, Hfx RT and concurrent low-dose daily CDDP offered a survival advantage, as well as improved LRPFS and DMFS. We have demonstrated that three different approaches of concurrent multiagent chemotherapy and radiation were feasible and could be delivered to patients in a multi-institutional setting with high compliance rates. I-FU patients also experienced greater morbidity, but this did not compromise delivery of radiotherapy. The timing of the methotrexate with radiotherapy has a significant influence on primary control and survival in head and neck cancer. Since head and neck cancer patients are a heterogeneous group, there may be particular sites and stages for which adjuvant chemotherapy would be advantageous, and subset analysis can help indicate directions for new trials. The rates of secondary localization and distant metastasis were not significantly different in the two groups. The therapeutic index of hyperfractionated radiotherapy is improved by concomitant cisplatin. Nor was there any impact of chemotherapy on the number of patients achieving loco-regional tumor control after primary treatment. Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society These differences do not exist in the POC group, which may be due to the systematically postoperative radiotherapy. Long-term analysis (10 yr) is given. Chemotherapy responders are more likely to respond to radiation therapy. The study has been discontinued because statistical analysis indicated that the addition of more patients would not materially increase the statistical significance of the study. Copyright 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society. The loss of efficacy resulting from split-course radiation was not offset by either multiagent chemotherapy or the possibility of midcourse surgery. A significant improvement regarding local tumour control and survival was seen following administration of MMC to the accelerated fractionated treatment. From results of our prospective randomized study it seems that the group of patients that received multidrug treatment with Mytomycin C, Bleomycin, Nicotinamide, Chlorpromazine, and Dicoumarol as enhancers of radiotherapy fared better than patients treated by radiotherapy alone. Although we could not show a benefit in survival with the CDDP + 5-FU protocol, this trial supports literature data and confirms that this regimen may be proposed as a first-line therapy in advanced cancer of the head and neck. If efforts in determining a chemotherapy-sensitive patient were successfully established, along with a better sequence and the discovery of new and safer drugs, survival of SCCHN should be much improved. Induction TPF followed by CT/RT was associated with higher radiologic CR in patients with locally advanced SCCHN with no negative impact on CT/RT feasibility. However, our findings do not exclude that carboplatin may be beneficial, but the benefit in local control must be lower than the 15% assumed to dimension the trial. The subgroup analysis shows the major improvement of alternating CT and RT in patients with the worst prognostic characteristics. However, since local disease cannot be controlled in over half the patients who receive the combined treatment and since almost two thirds die within three years, further improvements in management are necessary. Prophylactic G-CSF resulted in an unexpected reduced local control and should be given in radiotherapy regimen only with strong hematologic indication. Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society. This trial suggests the need to test new chemotherapy protocols according to new schemes of treatment, with chemotherapy given concurrently with or following the completion of standard treatment by means of multicenter randomized trials. Catheter management problems, toxic effects and lethal reactions were 2.5 times more frequent in the MTX group. This study suggests that induction along with concomitant chemoradiotherapy is too toxic for routine use and also fails to provide a survival benefit. For these unresectable cases, chemoradiation provides better outcome than radiation alone, even with an "aggressive" dose-intensity radiotherapy schedule. Confirmatory studies with effective chemotherapy regimens delivered for an adequate number of cycles are required. Therefore, we recommend further controlled trials to investigate the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with primary resectable carcinomas of the oral cavity and tonsils and stage T2-T3 and N0-N2 disease prior to surgery. Anemia was the most important prognostic factor for survival in both arms. Increased total treatment time does not exert a negative impact on outcome in this combined modality regimen. After adjustment for these factors, the chemotherapy did not seem to improve the effectiveness of the local treatment in terms of loco-regional control and survival.

However, since neither regimen was likely to cause a CR rate of greater than 50%, this study was closed to further patient accrual. The demonstrated improvement appeared to be significant with the Gehan-Wilcoxon test as well as with the log rank test below a P value of 5%. Variations in the criteria used to select patients for these treatment options may make it difficult to generalize these results, but there appears to be room for using preoperative chemotherapy to spare destructive surgery or radiation therapy in patients with advanced, resectable oral cavity cancer. Increased in radiation toxicity by chemotherapy was not observed. This final analysis demonstrates no benefit in survival using preoperative chemotherapy for advanced stage, resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Our study provided further clinical evidence in support of the concepts of Goldie and Coleman that the timing of chemotherapeutic drugs is very critical for a successful end result. We could not demonstrate a benefit with the addition of carboplatin to postoperative radiotherapy, possibly because of insufficient sample size. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2009. The combination of induction and simultaneous chemoradiotherapy resulted in excellent survival in these patients. Survival results need to be assessed in a larger series and followed for a more prolonged time. Hyperthermia did not confer any benefit. However, bleomycin had no significant effect on the 3-and 5-year survival rates, and it did not significantly reduce the incidence of local recurrences. Late high grade toxicity was infrequent and similar between the three treatment groups. We found no evidence that the addition of TPZ to chemoradiotherapy, in patients with advanced head and neck cancer not selected for the presence of hypoxia, improves OS. Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society Our results indicate that CDDP-FU is more effective than CBDCA-FU as neoadjuvant treatment in stage IV-M0 head and neck cancer. Combined treatment for advanced head and neck cancer is more efficacious and not more toxic than hyperfractionated irradiation alone. The authors plan to reactivate the trial with modification in the induction chemotherapy and the addition of postradiation maintenance CT consisting of sequential bleomycin and cis-platinum. At the same time more mucosal and skin toxicity was encountered when Gemcitabine is given concurrently with radiation. Cisplatin/UFT was as effective as the classic cisplatin/5-FU regimen and has the advantages of outpatient oral administration and a lower incidence of phlebitis.

173,CD005276,"Intraoperative lidocaine is safe and effective in controlling intraoperative discomfort. This study found no additional benefit of intracameral unpreserved lignocaine when performing routine clear corneal phacoemulsification under topical anaesthesia. Although topical lidocaine alone provides adequate anesthesia for phacoemulsification and implantation of a foldable IOL, combined topical and intracameral administration of lidocaine can further minimize intraoperative discomfort. Intracameral injections of unpreserved lidocaine safely and effectively reduced intraocular sensation during phacoemulsification. Injection of intraocular lidocaine increases patient cooperation and decreases the degree to which patients are bothered by tissue manipulation, two outcomes that justify its use. None of the other parameters measured in this study differed significantly between the 2 groups. In this study, the routine use of intracameral lidocaine as a supplement to topical anesthesia was shown not to have a clinically useful role. In a rigorously double-masked, prospective, randomized, controlled trial there was no significant reduction in intraoperative pain when intracameral 1% lidocaine was used during phacoemulsification under topical anesthesia."

It reduces the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, delays the development of hepatorenal syndrome, and improves survival.

177,CD001036,"The results of this study indicate that (1) method B (Cytobrush plus spatula) and method C (Cytopick) give superior results in the preparation of EC+ smears and in the detection of CIN III and thus should be used in population screening programs, and (2) methods A and D should not be used for cervical cytologic sampling in such programs. In swabbed postmenopausal women, use of a Milex spatula had a significantly higher yield than the use of a wooden spatula and a cotton-tipped applicator (43 percent vs 27 percent, P less than .03). The use of the latter instrument meant that the number of repeat smears necessitated due to the absence of endocervical cells could be considerably reduced, with consequent improvement in the cost/benefit ratio. Quantitative studies thus showed that the Aylesbury gave no more accurate results than the Ayre spatula. When endocervical columnar cells are absent, the smear should be considered to be of unreliable quality and a repeat smear should be taken after a short interval, unless the absence of columnar cells can be satisfactorily explained. Their competence in executing their tasks must be frequently reviewed. We recommend that surveillance of patients who have received local ablative therapy for CIN should be by both cytology and colposcopy, and that cytological samples should be obtained using the Ayre's spatula. Regular monitoring of the type described, which is both practical and reasonably comprehensive, is recommended for all laboratories. A large-scale application of the spatula-Cytobrush method should result in fewer repeat smears required and fewer false-negative smears. It is the conclusion of this study that both ectocervical and endocervical sampling should routinely be used. The cotton swab-spatula and Cytobrush-spatula appear to be the most effective screening methods for nonpregnant and pregnant patients, respectively. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) There were major differences in the quality of the smears between the various sample takers. A significantly higher number of moderately and severely atypical epithelial changes was found in smears with endocervical cells as compared with smears without endocervical cells. In terms of the sequence of smears, the second smear generally contained more endocervical cells and less often showed an absence of diagnostic cells. Although the data in the present study were too few to prove that the Armovical spatula is better than the Ayre spatula at detecting cellular abnormalities, it seems likely that this is so. The Cervex seems capable of producing such samples and deserves further evaluation for routine screening. This study illustrates how spurious conclusions of sampling efficacy can be drawn if only one type of indicator cell is used as an endpoint. The endocervical brush is superior to the cotton swab in obtaining satisfactory Papanicolaou smears after cryosurgery, laser ablation and conization. The suggestion of advantage for the Aylesbury spatula merits further investigation. The Zelsmyr Cytobrush cell collector is an effective instrument, yielding increased numbers of endocervical cells on Papanicolaou smear. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) There was no statistically significant difference between the Cytobrush-Ayre spatula and the Cervex brush sampling methods were equally effective in obtaining endocervical cells in Papanicolaou smears. This suggests that smears lacking endocervical cells are less sensitive in screening for dysplasia and should be repeated when clinically appropriate. These findings suggest that, in women who have had laser treatment of the cervix, Cytobrush plus Ayre spatula sampling produces better-quality smears than does Cervex brush sampling, with regard to both adequacy and the presence of endocervical cells. No difference was found between the methods with regard to detection of dyskaryosis, although there were significant differences in the percentage of smears containing endocervical cells. We recommend that an ectocervical sample be obtained only after a straight brush is used to obtain an endocervical sample. Based on the cost per item and a clinically significant increase in endocervical cell yield, we recommend the Cytobrush and modified Ayers spatula for cytologic screening in pregnant women. Therefore the rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) diagnosis is more influenced by an adequate sampling of the endocervix than by the type of endocervical device. We concluded that the Multispatula produces a better quality smear which results in a decreased false negative rate in comparison with the Ayres Spatula. Although it was associated with a slightly increased risk of bleeding, 83% of users preferred the trial spatula. It may be an alternative to the combination of an Ayre spatula and cytobrush for sampling the cervix. Application of the Bethesda System results in a significant number of less-than-optimal smears using either technique."

These findings suggest that the SBP was as efficient and effective as the CBP but was significantly more comfortable to use for pump-dependent mothers of very low birthweight infants. Of the remaining mothers who produced 1700 g to 3500 g at week 2, 54% achieved adequate production during weeks 4 and 5 postpartum. Mothers' preferences regarding pumping regimen influenced mean milk volumes obtained in the direction of the women's preferences. Further development of interventions to help obese women achieve optimal breastfeeding outcomes is required. As frequent and efficient milk removal is essential for continued production of milk, mothers of preterm infants wishing to express milk for their sick babies should be taught these techniques.

Zinc supplementation has no effect on morbidity from falciparum malaria in children in rural west Africa, but it does reduce morbidity associated with diarrhoea. Previously described differences in growth between breastfed and formula-fed infants in such populations do not appear to be due to differences in zinc nutriture. Thus, the use of a zinc-fortified formula during nutritional rehabilitation can prevent the development of zinc deficiency and improve growth and immune function. However, compliance with weekly intake might be problematic outside a research programme. Zinc supplementation substantially reduced the incidence of pneumonia in children who had received vitamin A. Combined, simultaneous supplementation with iron and zinc to infants cannot be routinely recommended at the iron-to-zinc ratio used in this study."
186,CD003071,"It should be emphasized that incident pain is far more decreased by PCEA, so that this technique is particularly indicated when an early postoperative mobilization is required. Regional analgesic techniques improve early rehabilitation after major knee surgery by effectively controlling pain during continuous passive motion, thereby hastening convalescence. The incidence of calf vein thrombosis was 12% compared with 45% after general anaesthesia (P = 0.05). Total blood loss was reduced by 31.3% by epidural anaesthesia, 20.4% by Aprotinin and 51.4% using a combination of the two techniques. We conclude that effective early (48 h) postoperative pain relief with balanced analgesia does not per se lead to important improvements in convalescence and hospital stay. The present study shows that extradural pethidine produces shortlived analgesia, in contrast to the long-lasting effect of morphine found in other studies. Epidural morphine provides a better analgesia than intravenous PCA-fentanyl. Epidural analgesia with a combination of bupivacaine and fentanyl did not result in any measurable improvement in rehabilitation milestones or reduction in postoperative complications following bilateral total knee arthroplasty than with fentanyl infusions alone. In major orthopaedic procedures, application of intraarticular morphine does not reduce analgesic requirements. ketoprofen and extradural morphine, we conclude that ketoprofen may be an efficient alternative to extradural morphine after hip and knee arthroplasty. Because it causes fewer side effects than epidural analgesia, continuous 3-in-1 block is the technique of choice. The authors conclude that epidural morphine may provide more consistent analgesia following joint replacement surgery than patient-controlled morphine; however, there is a higher incidence of side-effects with the epidural technique. Compared with general anesthesia and postoperative IV patient-controlled analgesia with morphine, epidural anesthesia and analgesia with the new local anesthetic ropivacaine enables patients to be discharged sooner from a postanesthesia care unit and provides superior pain relief during the first 24 h after hip replacement."
187,CD002784,"Appropriate handling of acute ischaemic conditions implies the use of both thrombolysis and appropriate surgical procedures, including distal bypass grafts. These benefits were achieved without an appreciable increase in the duration of hospitalization and with only modest increases in hospital cost, suggesting that thrombolytic therapy may offer a safe and effective alternative to operation in the initial treatment of patients diagnosed with acute limb-threatening peripheral arterial occlusion. Despite its association with a higher frequency of hemorrhagic complications, intraarterial infusion of urokinase reduced the need for open surgical procedures, with no significantly increased risk of amputation or death."
188,CD002055,"In hypotensive neonates, ALB results in a greater likelihood of achieving normotension and decreased subsequent use of vasopressors when compared to NS. Isotonic saline is as effective as 5% albumin for treating hypotension in preterm infants, and it has the additional advantage of causing less fluid retention in the first 48 hours. Following exchange transfusion there was a significant decrease in the ratio of FIO2 to PaO2, suggesting that pulmonary perfusion and/or ventilation was improved by the procedure. Fresh frozen plasma appears to have a beneficial effect in the prevention of intraventricular haemorrhage. Despite the low CCr and the high urinary sodium excretion rate, infants of G less than 30 had stable fluid and electrolyte balance. It is concluded that the volume infused rather than albumin load is important in producing a sustained increase in blood pressure. However, the variance on the measurement of cerebral blood flow indicates that a small but clinically significant effect may have been overlooked."
189,CD004685,"Both griseofulvin and terbinafine are equally effective in the treatment of tinea capitis. Each of the agents has a favorable adverse-effects profile. Both ketoconazole and griseofulvin were useful drugs for treatment of dermatophytoses in children. Ketoconazole shows promise as an alternative to griseofulvin for treating children with tinea capitis. Adverse events noted were mild and did not warrant discontinuation of therapy. When efficacy, cost, and compliance are taken into consideration, 2 weeks of terbinafine therapy appears to be the optimal treatment duration for patients with Trichophyton tonsurans tinea capitis. The time for complete scalp clearing was significantly longer in patients who received ketoconazole (median, 108 days) compared with those who were treated with griseofulvin (median, 60 days) (P = 0.01). In our opinion, terbinafine given for 1, 2 or 4 weeks, is equally effective for most cases of tinea capitis. Fluconazole constitutes an alternative but, because of greater availability and lower cost, griseofulvin remains the treatment of choice for tinea capitis. Overall, the study showed that 4 weeks of treatment with oral terbinafine has similar efficacy to 8 weeks of treatment with griseofulvin for the management of tinea capitis in children. The drug also appears to be better tolerated than griseofulvin. We conclude that griseofulvin should remain the drug of choice for treating tinea capitis. No significant side effects were reported. tinea capitis, although additional treatment (a third pulse) may be needed if clinical improvement is not evident at 8 weeks after initiating therapy. Terbinafine is well tolerated, and requires 2 weeks of treatment in most patients with Trichophyton scalp infections and 4 weeks or more in Microsporum scalp infections, to achieve a successful clinical and mycological response. However, further clinical trials are required in order to optimize the dose regimen to allow higher cure rates to be reached."
190,CD007806,"In our study, the H2O2 mouth rinse does not provide a better analgesic effect than the water rinse for post-tonsillectomy pain relief. Results showed that the benzydamine spray was more effective than placebo in the control of post-operative pain. But lidocaine was more preferable, reducing pain in the third postop day better than bupivacaine. The efficacy of benzydamine hydrochloride (Difflam) spray to relieve pain from postoperative tonsillectomy was assessed, but it was found that it did not relieve the symptoms after operation when compared to matching placebo."
191,CD001705,"In displaced fractures, impaction caused a decrease in femoral head vitality. Thus, compression cannot be recommended when displaced femoral neck fractures are treated with a sliding-screw-plate. A delay of more than 48 hours before surgery did not influence the rate of union or the development of AVN when compared with operation within 48 hours of injury."
192,CD004957,"Clinical pathway is an effective method of improving patient outcomes and decreasing length of stay following hip and knee arthroplasty. Our preoperative education program, followed by postoperative home-based rehabilitation, appears to be safer and more effective in improving function and QOL after THR than conventional treatment. An abbreviated set of home care visits resulted in more-efficient delivery of care without compromising patient outcomes. Thus, the cost of hospital at home compared with hospital care becomes a primary concern. These data showed that high-risk individuals were able to tolerate early intensive rehabilitation, and this intervention yielded faster attainment of short-term functional milestones in fewer days using less total cost."
193,CD009415,"There was a significant reduction of the mean number of infective episodes and associated morbidity in patients with sickle cell anaemia. Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Administration of zinc could, therefore, be considered as an effective adjuvant therapy in homozygous beta-thalassemia. Prepubertal children with SCD-SS may have zinc deficiency and may benefit from zinc supplementation to improve linear growth and weight gain. We conclude that androgen deficiency in adult male subjects with sickle cell anemia is correctable with zinc supplementation and that the determination of neutrophil zinc and alkaline phosphatase activity in the neutrophils may be utilized as good indicators of body zinc status in such subjects. Our results suggest that beta thalassemic patients have enhanced oxidative stress and administration of selective antioxidants may preclude oxidative damage."
194,CD009110,"It is concluded that the collagen-alginate test dressing is as or more effective and safe as the currently used treatment. As compared with vaseline gauze, calcium alginate appears to be more appropriate for topical treatment of diabetic foot lesions in terms of both healing and tolerance. This study reports the first significant clinical effects of a primary wound dressing containing silver on DFU healing."
195,CD005959,"However, there appears to be no difference between the two groups in terms of the rate of union and functional outcome. For patients requiring surgical treatment of a humeral shaft fracture, intramedullary nailing and compression plating both provide predictable methods for achieving fracture stabilization and ultimate healing. Fixation by IMN may be indicated for specific situations, but is technically more demanding and has a higher rate of complications. Despite higher non-union rates, intramedullary nailing may be the method of choice in the treatment of humerus fractures because of such advantages as low morbidity, small dissection of soft tissues, and greater ease of application."
196,CD002047,"These are the first 6- and 12-month randomized placebo- and active drug-controlled trials to demonstrate retardation of radiographic progression by a new disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), LEF, as well as 2 commonly used DMARDs, MTX and SSZ. LEF was equally effective as MTX in patients unable to continue MTX treatment due to the drug's ineffectiveness. Improvement in synovial inflammation as measured by IRE was significantly better with leflunomide than with methotrexate over 4 months of therapy. Fewer adverse events were reported in patients switched to LEF without a loading dose. If regular monitoring of hepatic function and hematological parameters are performed, leflunomide is an effective and safe drug in the Indian population in resistant rheumatoid arthritis patients, especially if used alone. Leflunomide plus methotrexate is generally well tolerated and can be used safely with appropriate liver enzyme and hematologic monitoring. LEF had a good therapeutic effect for RA, especially for refractory RA and had slight side reactions, and could be regarded as a superior immunosuppressive agent used in the treatment of RA and other connective tissue diseases. Its efficacy is similar to MTX, but the incidence of adverse events and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events were lower in the leflunomide group than in MTX group. The use of leflunomide in a weekly dose of 100 mg proved to have similar therapeutic benefit as that of the conventional scheme and might represent a new option for the treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients. This drug may be a useful option as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. This study demonstrates that slowing of disease progression with leflunomide, observed as early as 6 months, is maintained long term in patients who complete 2 years of treatment. These findings were clinically meaningful and correlated with the ACR response status. Patient numbers are small and firm conclusions cannot be reached, but a non-significant benefit is indicated for combining leflunomide with sulfasalazine compared with switching to sulfasalazine alone in patients inadequately responding to leflunomide. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials using daily doses of 10 mg and 20 mg are under way in the US and Europe to confirm these positive results. More AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation and SAEs in patients receiving 10 mg leflunomide daily also support a better efficacy profile for the 20 mg daily dose. Results indicate that LEF is a safe and effective initial treatment for active RA, with clinical benefit sustained over 2 years of treatment without evidence of new or increased toxicity. Efficiency of RA treatment with MTX or LEF in intensified doses and in combination with moderate dose prednisone can be sufficiently judged 8 weeks after its initiation. The benefit of leflunomide is reflected in other efficacy criteria, such as global assessments and the American College of Rheumatology response rates, all of which showed significantly more improvement with leflunomide than sulfasalazine at 24 months. These long term data confirm that leflunomide is an efficacious and safe disease modifying antirheumatic drug. Both active treatments improved signs and symptoms of active RA, delayed disease progression as demonstrated by x-ray films, and improved function and health-related quality of life. Adverse events were not substantially increased."

Post hoc analysis suggests GA may have slowed clinical progression in male patients who showed more rapid progression when untreated. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Two-year progression rates for two secondary end points, unconfirmed progression, and progression of 0.5 EDSS units, (p = 0.03) are significant.

199,CD006229,"It is concluded that postoperative pulmonary function is less impaired after laparoscopic cholecystectomy than after either mini-incision or Kocher's incision cholecystectomy. The magnitude of the acute-phase response was less pronounced following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, consistent with a reduction in tissue trauma. LC is a more cost-effective method for treatment of gallstone disease. Compared to minilaparotomy cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in shorter hospital stay, less postoperative dysfunction, and quicker return to normal activities, but is more costly. Consequently, although laparoscopic cholecystectomy shows a better outcome in terms of socioeconomic aspects and patient compliance, in an attempt to rationalize hospital expenditure, we would advocate mini-cholecystectomy for those patients who do not need to return to work early. There was no significant cost difference between the two procedures. Further analyses of LC versus MC are necessary regarding surgical training, surgical outcome, and health economy. Minimal access surgery induces an acute phase response that is less prominent after a laparoscopic technique. This randomised trial shows the superior effectiveness of LC over MC in treating cholelithiasis. The beneficial effects of laparoscopic surgery may relate, in part, to preservation of immune function in the postoperative period. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy takes longer to do than small-incision cholecystectomy and does not have any significant advantages in terms of hospital stay or postoperative recovery. Patients with LCCE had significant less postoperative pain, less restriction of total vital capacity and a shorter postoperative hospital stay as parameters of a diminished operative trauma."

201,CD008107,"In conclusion, although this clinical trial failed to demonstrate a significant benefit of preoperative chemotherapy because of the low dose of 5'-DFUR, we believe that good compliance with oral anticancer treatment contributes to long-term survival and that 5'-DFUR reduces hematogeneous metastasis of gastric carcinoma. Until large randomised studies prove otherwise, adequate surgery without delay is the best treatment for operable gastric cancer. In patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, GEJ, or stomach, perioperative chemotherapy using fluorouracil plus cisplatin significantly increased the curative resection rate, disease-free survival, and OS. Future trials should target patients with minimal residual disease. Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society. Preoperative oral 5'-DFUR administration may induce apoptosis of gastric carcinoma cells and decrease tumor cell proliferation index,but cannot improve the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.Down-regulation of FasL and PD-ECGF expression mediated by 5'-DFUR may be one of its anti-cancer mechanisms.Fas expression correlates with the progression of gastric carcinoma and may be an effective prognostic factor. Long-term follow-up confirms that preoperative chemotherapy improves survival in operable esophageal cancer and should be considered as a standard of care. However, further assessment is warranted of the role of chemoradiotherapy in patients with squamous-cell tumours. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2). Preoperative FPLC chemotherapy might improve the survival rate of patients with gastric cardia cancer by inhibiting tumour proliferative, invasive and metastatic activities, and stimulating the patient's immune system. The results from this trial reflect a long-term survival advantage with the use of chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery in the treatment of esophageal cancer, and support trimodality therapy as a standard of care for patients with this disease. After a R1 resection, postoperative chemoradiotherapy therapy offers the possibility of long-term disease-free survival to a small percentage of patients. This randomized trial of preoperative chemoradiation versus surgery alone for patients with potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma did not demonstrate a statistically significant survival difference."
202,CD001293,"The extracurricular activities approach to tobacco control is practical to implement and has promise. Copyright 2005 APA, all rights reserved. Self-control condition subjects reported less weekly cigarette smoking compared with placebo and control condition subjects at final follow-up. The lack of behavioral effects may have been the result of imperfect program implementation or low base rates of intentions and behavior. The girls in the group also evidenced lower rates of substance use initiation, while the boys exhibited increased social and school work skills. Potential explanations for outcomes relative to Project ALERT's original effectiveness trial are discussed, as well as implications for future research, including the need to conduct independent effectiveness studies of previously validated programs in a variety of contexts. Inadequate implementation of the programme by some teachers may have been associated with adverse effects on the children's behaviour, attitudes and knowledge. As smoking-prevention programmes only may delay the onset of smoking in children, it is important that legislative measures be introduced to reduce the effects of cigarette advertising. The prevention effect among Hispanic boys is encouraging, but additional research is needed to improve prevention effects among other groups. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The findings from this study show that a drug abuse prevention program originally designed for White middle-class adolescent populations is effective in a sample of minority, economically disadvantaged, inner-city adolescents.

Further research will be needed to develop effective school based health education projects, which should be formally field tested under normal conditions before widespread dissemination. curriculum among boys and was more effective than the delayed program controls, underscoring the potential for multiyear, multicomponent prevention programs and demonstrating sex differences in response to intervention programs. An effect on an ordinal count measure of hard drug use among both intervention conditions replicates previous work and suggests that this program effect may have been due to changes in cognitive misperception of drug use rather than behavioral skill. We propose this kind of intervention for Italian students as an effective and low-cost program, even though more research is needed to maintain effectiveness of these kind of programs beyond adolescence. The result demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of tobacco control in elementary school and the positive effect must be developed. This study provides the methodologically most rigorous test to date of social influence programs for smoking prevention and documents for the first time significant effects for those at high risk for smoking. The results of this study underscore the need for more robust prevention programming targeted specifically at risk factors, the inclusion of booster sessions to sustain positive effects, and greater attention to interrelationships between developmental processes in adolescent substance use, individual level characteristics, and social context. The program did have an effect on the refusal skills of participants and the validity of this effect was not jeopardized by differential attrition. The results also suggest that additional interventions in later years are needed to maintain the effect. We discuss methodological issues in multicomponent community-based interventions, and highlight the strengths and limitations of this study. Further studies are required to determine ASPIRE's effects on cessation. The Going Places Program was effective in preventing increases in smoking progression, but its efficacy as a more cross-cutting problem behavior preventive intervention was not confirmed. Consistent with previous trials, there is no evidence from this trial that a school-based social-influences approach is effective in the long-term deterrence of smoking among youth. The results suggest that comprehensive community wide interventions can improve on the preventive effect of school based tobacco prevention programmes and that effective tobacco prevention may prevent other substance use. The programmatic and methodological challenges faced by the Adolescent Substance Abuse Prevention Study (ASAPS) and lessons learned offer insights for prevention researchers who will be designing similar randomized field trials in the future. At the end of grade seven, program students' rates of substance use had increased significantly less and knowledge of alcohol pressures, effects, and skills to resist had increased significantly more than those of comparison students. The effect of the combined approach was not larger than the sum of the effects of the in-school and the out-of-school effects. Because the program conditions were discriminable, yet were quite similar in implementation and process ratings, planned future study of behavioral outcomes can be interpreted as relatively uncontaminated by delivery or credibility confounds. Generally, the study points toward further development of a teacher-led approach to smoking deterence based on the theory of adolescent psychosocial development and the principle of continuous reinforcement. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. More intensive intervention, in the classroom and beyond, may be needed to further impact smoking behavior. Intervention programs in schools may, after sufficient duration, prove to be effective in lowering CHD risk. A school-based drug abuse prevention approach previously found to be effective among white youth significantly reduced smoking initiation and escalation among urban minority girls. Implementation remains the major challenge to delivering interventions via the Internet, both for health educators and researchers. Together with results from other recent studies, they suggest that even more intensive efforts may be required to effect widespread reductions in adolescent tobacco use. Possible reasons for gender differences and implications for prevention programming are discussed. Future smoking prevention projects should aim to identify the effective components within the social influence approach as well as within broader approaches and on reaching sustained effects. It is recommended that the SI program with the booster be implemented at the national level, since this intervention showed the greatest behavioral effects. Targeting early risk antecedents such as aggressive behavior appears to be an important smoking prevention strategy. The programme improved adolescents' smoking-related knowledge, but did not change their attitudes towards smoking. Project ALERT was not effective when delivered to the sixth grade population we targeted. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Long-term effectiveness was found for running activity. The smokers obtained cigarettes from kiosks, from friends, vending machines, vendors or shops, but seldom from their homes. Results provide further encouraging support for the use of peer-led pressure resistance training in preventing adolescent drug use. These results suggest that establishing conservative norms is an effective strategy for preventing substance use. Specific contrasts found the Mexican American and Multicultural versions impacted the most outcomes. More studies are needed to analyse how to maintain these effects over time. Such findings have implications for the age appropriateness of school-based programs. The promising sixth- through eighth-grade findings for SFA, a commercially available program, provide a further step in bridging a major gap in the "research to practice" literature: theory-based interventions that have documented behavioral effects have not enjoyed large-scale implementation, while intuition-based programs that have no documented effects still enjoy wide exposure. Significant changes consistent with nonsmoking were also evident on several cognitive, attitudinal, and personality variables. Findings underscore the utility of targeting more than one gateway substance to prevent escalation of drug involvement and reinforce the importance of social competence enhancement as an effective deterrent to early-stage drug use. Prevention effects were also found for normative expectations and knowledge concerning substance use, interpersonal skills, and communication skills. Our findings have implications for future substance-abuse prevention research with American-Indian people. The results suggest that, if implemented on a population basis, the ASSIST intervention could lead to a reduction in adolescent smoking prevalence of public-health importance. School curricula based on a comprehensive social-influence model may delay progression to daily smoking and episodes of drunkenness. Taken together with the results of other prevention studies, these results point to the need for the development and evaluation of new initiatives to prevent substance use. Culturally specific smoking prevention programs are needed for Chinese adolescents. These outcome data, student feedback and process evaluation provide a basis for continuing to create more innovative adolescent tobacco control programs. In Italy, the problem of educating young people about smoking is particularly pressing today. Tobacco-free policies appear to be a crucial part of school-based interventions and must be tailored to political and regional factors affecting a given school district. Possible substantive and methodological explanations for the relative lack of DARE's effectiveness observed in this study are discussed. It was concluded that sporadic educational intervention carried out during primary school years has little or no impact in preventing cigarette smoking in teenagers. Moreover, refusal skill quality was not related to overall tobacco use or cigarette use at any grade. The smoking prevention and cessation intervention based on the transtheoretical model, as delivered in this trial, is ineffective in schoolchildren aged 13-14. Overall, these results support the use of a smoking prevention strategy that focuses on the main psychosocial factors promoting the onset of cigarette smoking by teaching students basic coping skills. For students with a peer environment that supports substance use, an interactive program may have deleterious effects. The results suggest a modest but significant effect of the program, which seems to decrease over time for smoking, suggesting the need for booster interventions to maintain its effects. These results are consistent with other evaluations of the "Know Your Body" program, suggesting that the program may be effective in reducing chronic disease risk in diverse school populations. Using experimental procedures based on social work techniques, this study suggests that social work efforts are an effective tool in programs and services that focus on primary prevention. The results of Project Northland suggest that multilevel, targeted prevention programs for young adolescents are effective in reducing alcohol use. Results suggest that programming should target high-risk schools. We conclude that this peer pressure resistance skill program was effective in preventing experimentation with tobacco among sixth graders in Tijuana, Mexico. Results are discussed in relation to the planning of future programs designed to address the importance of peer and parental role models. The intervention study has the potential to elucidate how youth respond to an intervention with student involvement that incorporates cognitive and social action components. It is likely that a classroom-based smoking prevention/cessation program can lead to lower overall smoking prevalence than a cessation program that is implemented in a school-based smoking cessation clinic format. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. School-based drug prevention programs can prevent occasional and more serious drug use, help low- to high-risk adolescents, and be effective in diverse school environments. The "Smoke-Free Class Competition" did not prevent smoking among adolescents and does not appear to be an effective substitute to the complete ban of tobacco advertising, the abolition of vending machines and the creation of smoke-free environments in German schools. The results showed that a LST program was effective for preventing tobacco and drug use in Thai high school students. These findings demonstrate the potential of skills intervention methods for lowering tobacco use rates among adolescents. It is concluded that brief family skills-training interventions designed for general populations have the potential to reduce adolescent substance use and thus have important public health implications. Conclusions about the effects of skills intervention are strengthened by the common preparation and random assignment of intervention leaders and by process measurement data. The study's strengths and limits are discussed along with directions for future smoking prevention research. The project had a significant impact on tobacco use. By the final post-test, classrooms that had received the affective program had significantly more drug use than controls. Finally, gender differences were apparent across substances, measurements, and study arms, with girls smoking more cigarettes and boys using more smokeless tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. The authors present a model that can be employed to prevent other high-risk behaviors within the Black population. Long-term sustained effects for cigarette and marijuana use, and both vigorous and moderate physical activity, were found among adolescents using marijuana and/or cigarettes prior to intervention. This suggests that routine implementation of smoking prevention programs in conventional school settings may be productive in reducing the prevalence of cigarette smoking. By providing an accessible and attractive method of engaging young people in smoking prevention and cessation, this interactive and integrated program provides a novel vehicle for school- and population-level health promotion. Although modest, effects were achieved with minimal intervention time in a high-risk group, indicating that social-influences prevention programs may be effective in such groups. The effect of the program on recruitment of smokers seems to have been at least as strong or even stronger among 'high-risk' students than among other students. Relative to randomized matched controls, adolescents whose parents engaged in the Family Check-Up exhibited less growth in alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use and problem behavior during ages 11 through 17, along with decreased risk for substance use diagnoses and police records of arrests by age 18. Relative reduction rates for alcohol initiation were 30.0% for the combined intervention and 4.1% for LST only. Implications for prevention and research are discussed. It is clear that prevention programming will have to consider targeting males and females in different ways. We conclude that a non-smoking intervention of 8 lessons in the 7th grade of high schools and secondary modern schools may lower the rate of first-time consumers of cigarettes but not of alcohol and drugs. The school-based adolescent harm minimization intervention appears to have been more effective than the abstinence-based social influences programme at reducing regular smoking. Although the effects were relatively small, intervention programs in schools may prove to be effective in lowering chronic disease risk. Results support the community-university partnership model for recruitment that was implemented in the study. School-based programs similar to the intervention examined here should be considered as part of a multistrategy approach to reducing tobacco use among young people in India. The impact of YAT is consistent with experimental and nonexperimental evaluations of media campaigns to influence young people not to smoke. The adolescents' demand for interactive learning and their development of attitudes and tobacco use habits in relation to family and friends provide opportunities to use new pedagogical models. Moreover, the prevention program is also capable of producing a significant impact on several hypothesized mediating variables. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Lamotrigine in low doses might be beneficial for headache frequency; however, longer trials are required to establish its efficacy on the intensity and frequency of migraine. Topiramate showed significant efficacy in migraine prevention within the first month of treatment, an effect maintained for the duration of the double-blind phase. TPM 100 mg/d and PROP 160 mg/d exhibited similar efficacy profiles. These results confirmed in humans the inhibiting action of levetiracetam on neuronal hyper-synchronization. However, compared with propranolol, low-dose topiramate showed better results. Topiramate dose of 50 mg/day with fewer side effects in comparison with its higher doses may be an appropriate substitution for first-line migraine prophylaxis such as valproate. Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Exercise may be an option for the prophylactic treatment of migraine in patients who do not benefit from or do not want to take daily medication. Topiramate was effective in reducing headache days and migraine headache days and generally well tolerated. Topiramate was associated with improvement in some quality-of-life indicators compared with amitriptyline and was associated with weight loss and improved weight satisfaction. TPM has thus proven its efficacy and tolerability in the prophylaxis of migraine. This effect of topiramate and sodium valporate has previously been shown to reduce migraine headache, and we postulate that treatment with topiramate and sodium valporate may have a similar benefit. Topiramate, 100 or 200 mg/d, was effective as a preventive therapy for patients with migraine. Larger multicenter clinical studies may further delineate the role of topiramate in migraine prevention. In this pilot study, mean monthly migraine frequency did not differ significantly between TPM and placebo."

It also illustrates some of the difficulties involved in the study of diet in arthritis. A proportion of the improvement was due to a placebo response, but this was not sufficient to explain the whole improvement. patients where foods aggravate disease activity. We conclude that fasting may produce subjective and objective improvements in RA, though of short duration, but the findings of this investigation do not indicate that lactovegetarian diet has any beneficial effects. This study supports the concept that rheumatoid arthritis may be a reaction to a food antigen(s) and that the disease process starts within the intestine. Large amounts of living lactobacilli consumed daily may also have positive effects on objective measures of rheumatoid arthritis. The data provide evidence that dietary modification may be of clinical benefit for certain RA patients, and that this benefit may be related to a reduction in immunoreactivity to food antigens eliminated by the change in diet. However, our data are not inconsistent with the possibility that individualized dietary manipulations might be beneficial for selected patients with rheumatic disease. The results indicate that patients with RA, by adjusting to a Mediterranean diet, did obtain a reduction in inflammatory activity, an increase in physical function, and improved vitality. However, the results do not encourage treatment with an elemental diet in unselected RA patients."

208,CD002752,"This intervention is feasible but, when applied indiscriminately to every discharged heart failure patient, the best that can be expected is only a modest reduction in readmission and death rates, which, in this study in particular, did not achieve statistical significance. Simple interventions can improve ACE inhibitor use and patient outcomes. This management strategy is cost-effective and has an equitable value from a societal point of view. Copyright 2001 The European Society of Cardiology. A hybrid DMP for elderly heart failure patients improves outcomes and is cost-effective over a long-term follow-up. This comprehensive hospital discharge and outpatient management program prolonged time to first event, reduced hospital readmissions, improved survival and quality of life of patients hospitalized for HF, while reducing cost of management. When our results are integrated with those from other, similar trials, multidisciplinary disease management strategies for congestive heart failure are associated with clinically worthwhile improvements in survival. A management programme for patients with heart failure discharged after hospitalisation reduces health care costs and the need for readmission. However, such a programme does not seem to have a favourable influence on QoL or readmission rate during long term follow up. A home-based intervention has the potential to decrease the rate of unplanned readmissions and associated health-care costs, prolong event-free and total survival, and improve quality of life among patients with chronic CHF. More comprehensive health economic evaluation needs to be undertaken. Follow up after hospitalisation at a nurse-led heart failure clinic can improve survival and self-care behaviour in patients with heart failure as well as reduce the number of events, readmissions and days in hospital. More intense follow-up monitoring and more resources are needed to achieve better results. A formal education and support intervention substantially reduced adverse clinical outcomes and costs for patients with HF. Such programs may be less effective for patients at low risk than those at high risk. Specially trained nurses can improve the outcome of patients admitted to hospital with heart failure. A supportive educational nursing intervention is effective in improving self-care behavior in patients with advanced (New York Heart Association class III-IV) heart failure; however, a more intensive intervention is needed to show effectiveness in improving quality of life. Its beneficial effects on recurrent readmission and event-free survival are consistent with those applying either a home or clinic-based approach. Longer-term benefit likely requires more active chronic intervention, even among patients who appear clinically stable. Postdischarge pharmaceutical care allows for reducing the number of new admissions in patients with heart failure, the total days of hospital stay, and improves treatment compliance without increasing the costs of care. Clinical Trial Registry http://trialregister.nl Identifier: NCT 98675639. ISRCTN59427925. A comprehensive transitional care intervention for elders hospitalized with heart failure increased the length of time between hospital discharge and readmission or death, reduced total number of rehospitalizations, and decreased healthcare costs, thus demonstrating great promise for improving clinical and economic outcomes. This study demonstrates that a six-month, multidisciplinary approach to CHF management can improve important clinical outcomes at a similar cost in recently hospitalized high-risk patients with CHF."
209,CD001367,"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Physicians should try to identify patients who are at high risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism and are therefore potential candidates for indefinite oral anticoagulant therapy. In patients with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis, the clinical benefit associated with extending the duration of anticoagulant therapy to one year is not maintained after the therapy is discontinued. For patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism or permanent risk factors who have a high risk of recurrence, other trials are necessary to assess prolonged therapy beyond 6 months. Duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism provoked by a transient risk factor should not be reduced from 3 months to 1 month as this is likely to increase recurrent venous thromboembolism without achieving a clinically important decrease in bleeding. The difference between the two groups occurred between 6 weeks and 6 months after the start of treatment, and the rates of recurrence remained nearly parallel for 1 1/2 years thereafter. However, there was a trend toward a higher risk of major hemorrhage when anticoagulation was continued indefinitely. Patients with a first episode of idiopathic venous thromboembolism should be treated with anticoagulant agents for longer than three months."
210,CD005523,"Functional gains were achieved with both exercise programmes compared with the control group. This study concludes that both aquatic and land-based exercise programs are beneficial to patients with osteoarthritis. Confidence intervals around these ratios suggested wide variability of cost effectiveness of aquatic exercise. More detailed research is required to develop a better understanding of the types of exercise that will work for the different biomechanical subtypes of knee and hip OA and investigation is needed on access and environmental issues for physical activity programmes for older people, from both a provider and a participant perspective, the societal costs of the different approaches to the management of OA and longer term trends in outcome measures (costs and effects). In conclusion, EA and hydrotherapy, both in combination with patient education, induce long-lasting effects, shown by reduced pain and ache and by increased functional activity and quality of life, as demonstrated by differences in the pre- and post-treatment assessments."
211,CD004585,"Our study demonstrates the potential benefits of EMG biofeedback in conjunction with neurophysiologic rehabilitation technique to maximize the hand function in hemiplegic patients. The length of time elapsed since the stroke did not prove to be a significant factor. Electromyographic feedback was felt to be especially useful in its ability to enhance figure-background discrimination and bypass possible areas of sensory obtundation. Men had higher arm function scores than women before and at the end of treatment, but not at follow-up. The apparent potential for rehabilitation of chronic hemiplegic patients and the benefits afforded to physical therapists from a standardized therapeutic exercise protocol are discussed. Both the experimental and the control groups benefited from their treatment, but EMGBF was shown to have an additional effect, both in the experimental patients, and in the control patients when they switched over to the experimental treatment condition. Although EMG biofeedback was used as an adjunct to physiotherapy and represented clinical practice, the results provide little evidence to support the clinical significance of using EMG biofeedback to improve gait in the acute phase after stroke. The implications of the results for the employment of EMG feedback and other therapeutic procedures in motor rehabilitation are discussed. Ease of delivering care and other socioeconomic considerations become important factors in choosing either or both of these methods. It is argued that controlled trials are possible in biofeedback and that using patients as their own controls is not justified in view of the present findings and the previously reported literature. Our data confirm that the electromyographic biofeedback technique increases muscle strength and improves recovery of functional locomotion in patients with hemiparesis and foot-drop after cerebral ischemia."
212,CD004362,"The extrapyramidal side effects of risperidone and haloperidol were not significantly different. Risperidone plus a mood stabilizer was more efficacious than a mood stabilizer alone, and as efficacious as haloperidol plus a mood stabilizer, for the rapid control of manic symptoms and was well tolerated. Lorazepam may offer an efficacious and safe alternative to haloperidol as an adjunctive treatment to lithium in the clinical management of the early phase of manic agitation in a subgroup of bipolar patients. The rating scales are not sensitive enough to monitor manic psychopathology; this accounts for the lack of statistically significant differences among drug groups at treatment termination, despite the widely disparate discharge rates. Zuclopenthixol acetate fulfils many desires for an amended neuroleptic formulation for the initial treatment of acutely disturbed psychotic patients. We conclude that either combination treatment can be beneficial but CBZ-Li has the advantage because of fewer neurologic side effects. However, haloperidol carries a higher rate of extrapyramidal symptoms, whereas olanzapine is associated with weight gain. We conclude that CBZ appears to be a potentially useful drug in the treatment of acute mania. We conclude that risperidone monotherapy was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for bipolar mania and that efficacy was maintained over the long term. Divalproex oral loading may produce rapid onset of antimanic and antipsychotic response comparable to that of haloperidol and with minimal side effects in the initial treatment of acute psychotic mania in a subset of bipolar patients. Inspite of the relatively small sample size the results suggest (1) that haloperidol is superior to lithium for treating severely ill acute mania and (2) that while a haloperidol--lithium combination does not result in a significant increase in side effects, it is not superior to haloperidol alone."

The trial confirmed the safety of the intervention, but shows no sustained benefits in terms of vitamin A status beyond age 6 months or infant morbidity. Small weekly doses of vitamin A or beta-carotene given to women before conception, during pregnancy, and through 24 wk postpartum did not improve fetal or early infant survival in Nepal.

Clinical trials NCT00168597. OPV administered to newborn in turn has no adverse effect on the vitamin A status of the breastfed infants. We found no evidence that vitamin A supplementation affects infants' antibody responses to tetanus toxoid or oral polio vaccine delivered at EPI contacts. The finding that increased numbers of vitamin A doses were associated with a higher probability of bulging of the fontanelle suggests a cumulative effect. There was a tendency towards a cumulative effect of toxicity with increasing doses. This is in contrast with the results of trials in which older infants and children in this same population were supplemented. These results corroborate previous findings from studies in Indonesia and India and provide additional evidence that vitamin A supplementation shortly after birth can reduce infant mortality in South Asia.

In this study, good perinatal outcomes and patient satisfaction were maintained when the prenatal visit schedule proposed by the Expert Panel on the Content of Prenatal Care was observed. An alternative prenatal care program for low-risk patients reduced resource utilization without adversely affecting prenatal care process variables, pregnancy outcome or patient satisfaction.

Limited risk factor analysis did not clearly identify any subgroup other than females at greater risk of early thrombosis nor any subgroup deriving particular benefit from ticlopidine treatment. Furthermore, low-intensity, monitored-dose warfarin does not appear to prolong PTFE graft survival. A dose of 160 mg of aspirin per day is an effective, nontoxic antithrombotic regimen in patients on hemodialysis.

224,CD003122,"Use of hormone therapy to prevent dementia or cognitive decline in women 65 years of age or older is not recommended. These findings, coupled with previously reported WHI data, support the conclusion that the risks of estrogen plus progestin outweigh the benefits. Furthermore, the fact that these results were obtained in women who had been menopausal for an average of 17 years before entering the study indicates that the brain maintains a sensitivity for estrogens even after years of low estradiol plasma concentrations. These findings suggest that variations in specific aspects of memory function may occur in surgically menopausal women coincident with changes in plasma estrone and estradiol levels. Other more efficacious and safer interventions need to be devised with the aim of improving the mental state and quality of life of older women. Postmenopausal treatment with ultra-low-dose unopposed transdermal estradiol for 2 years had no effect on change in cognitive function or in health-related quality of life over 2 years of treatment. These results suggest that estrogen use may improve the overall quality of life in postmenopausal women. Although conclusions are limited by small sample size and the relatively short duration of treatment, results suggest that 9 months of estrogen replacement in combination with trimonthly progestin does not improve cognitive performance in women over 75 years who do not have dementia or depression. Extraversion increased after 2 months of regimen A as compared to regimen P. Psychophysiological findings including pupillary and skin conductance variables were not significant. In elderly women, hormone replacement had no statistically significant effect on cognition or balance, nor did it prevent the age-related decline in physical measures of mobility, ability to rise from a chair, self-reported activities of daily living, physical activity scores, or falls. Our results extend prior findings about dementia and global cognitive function to age-related changes in specific cognitive functions and suggest directions for future research. Furthermore, the present study has demonstrated a differential effect of EHR on memory, visuospatial abilities and frontal lobe function. These results suggest that reproductive events and levels of endogenous estrogen are related to the clinical response to ERT, but larger studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to determine the strength of these effects. Short-term estrogen replacement therapy did not provide any advantage over the placebo in terms of improving the performance. These results suggest that sex steroids can modulate working memory in men and can act as modulators of cognition throughout life. It is concluded that 8 months of estrogen replacement therapy has no significant effect on central processing speed or postural stability in a healthy older female population. These results suggest that estrogen affects brain organization for memory in postmenopausal women."

226,CD003774,"Recipients who are treated for acute rejection are at risk for delayed CMV infection during the first posttransplantation year. We conclude that 2 grams a day of oral acyclovir provides effective prophylaxis against CMV disease in CMV-seropositive liver transplant recipients. An initial 12-week course of oral ganciclovir prevents CMV disease and infection in renal transplant recipients during prophylaxis, and the benefits persist after discontinuation. Prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir following a brief course of intravenous ganciclovir provides useful protection against primary CMV disease. A beneficial effect with regard to prevention of CMV disease seems to extend at least through 18 months after transplantation. Oral ganciclovir is a safe and effective method for the prevention of CMV disease after orthotopic liver transplantation. We conclude that the oral administration of acyclovir, beginning before the transplantation of a renal allograft from a cadaver, reduces the rate of cytomegalovirus infection and disease without affecting the survival rate of either grafts or patients. Our results show that oral ganciclovir is an effective and well tolerated therapy in the prevention of CMV infection in renal transplant patients. The prophylactic administration of ganciclovir after heart transplantation is safe, and in CMV-seropositive patients it reduces the incidence of CMV-induced illness. Prophylaxis of CMV infection in liver-transplant patients with 14 days of intravenous GCV followed by high-dosage oral ACV is more effective than high-dosage oral ACV alone at reducing CMV infection and disease, even for patients in the D+/R- CMV serological group. Valganciclovir suppresses lymphocyte proliferation and activation in patients after renal transplantation. Prophylactic treatment with valacyclovir is a safe and effective way to prevent CMV disease after renal transplantation. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Leucopaenia was not seen in patients receiving prophylactic ganciclovir. These results indicate that, after induction with 14 days of IV ganciclovir, oral ganciclovir can be as effective as IV ganciclovir for long-term prophylaxis of CMV disease in high-risk CMV-seronegative liver transplant recipients with CMV-seropositive donors and eliminates the need for prolonged IV access. Valacyclovir is associated with a significantly reduced risk of acute rejection compared with both ganciclovir prophylaxis and deferred therapy. In addition, the treatment is safe. Although CMV prevention appears to have considerable potential value in this population, definitive viral prophylaxis will require development of protracted or repeated treatment regimens, or longer-acting agents. We conclude that sequential prophylaxis with 2 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir followed by 50 weeks of high-dose oral acyclovir did not decrease the frequency of CMV or EBV disease after pediatric liver transplantation when compared with 2 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir alone. Moreover, it seems that CMV infection was not associated with acute rejection episodes. Decisions regarding prophylactic regimens should include additional criteria, such as cost or possible development of resistance. The number needed to treat to avoid one additional patient with CMV disease up to 12 months posttransplant is approximately 5. Our results show no beneficial effect of oral acyclovir prophylaxis in CMV high-risk renal transplant recipients. We conclude that acyclovir prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of CMV disease, and delayed the onset of CMV infection in liver transplant patients. Prolonged low-dose ganciclovir prophylaxis after heart transplantation reduces the incidence of cytomegalovirus disease in cytomegalovirus-mismatched patients and reduces the morbidity of cytomegalovirus disease in cytomegalovirus-positive recipients. Oral valacyclovir is a safe and effective mode of prophylaxis of CMV after heart transplantation. Preemptive ganciclovir therapy provides a cost-effective approach toward significantly improving the outcome of renal transplantation in CMV-seropositive patients treated with ALA. However, the lack of significant effect in seronegative recipients who received grafts from seropositive donors suggests that other strategies are needed to prevent CMV infection in this high risk population. These patients are likely to benefit most from the preventive strategy. Overall, once-daily oral valganciclovir was as clinically effective and well-tolerated as oral ganciclovir tid for CMV prevention in high-risk SOT recipients. The 3-times-weekly dosing regimen did not result in increased infection, disease, or sequelae of cytomegalovirus infection when compared with the daily regimen. This superior protection against CMV disease extends up to 1 year after transplantation and is not associated with ganciclovir resistance."

228,CD003654,"Ramipril, compared with amlodipine, retards renal disease progression in patients with hypertensive renal disease and proteinuria and may offer benefit to patients without proteinuria. Fosinopril and amlodipine had similar effects on biochemical measures, but the patients randomized to fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of major vascular events, compared with the patients randomized to amlodipine. However, treatment with chlorthalidone was associated with significantly higher incidences of hyperuricemia and hypokalemia than was treatment with verapamil. When considered in the context of other trials of calcium antagonists, these data indicate that the effectiveness of calcium-channel therapy in reducing cardiovascular disease is similar but not better than diuretic or beta-blocker treatment. Recruitment of patients started in September 1992 and so far more than 100 patients/week have been included. Since our findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation. The verapamil-trandolapril-based strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based strategy in hypertensive CAD patients. The greater efficacy of lacidipine on carotid IMT progression and number of plaques per patient, despite a smaller ambulatory blood pressure reduction, indicates an antiatherosclerotic action of lacidipine independent of its antihypertensive action. The findings emphasise the importance of prompt blood-pressure control in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk. End points include blood pressure change, side effects and quality-of-life indices; incidence of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities; and incidence of cardiovascular clinical events, including death, among participants receiving drugs as first-step treatment as well as nonpharmacologic treatment compared with incidence among those participants randomized to nonpharmacologic treatment only as the initial step. The composite cardiovascular event rate did not differ in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy treated with irbesartan, amlodipine, or placebo in addition to conventional antihypertensive therapy. In elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, administration of lacidipine or chlorthalidone markedly reduced systolic blood pressure with no difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events and total mortality. Nevertheless, the results have implications with respect to optimum combinations of antihypertensive agents. Further features of the rationale, design, objectives, treatment program, and study organization of ALLHAT are described in this article. The choice of drug can be decided by tolerability and blood-pressure response rather than long-term safety or efficacy. The increased incidence of vascular events in patients receiving isradipine compared with hydrochlorothiazide is of concern and should be studied further. Diltiazem was as effective as treatment based on diuretics, beta-blockers, or both in preventing the combined primary endpoint of all stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death."
229,CD007519,"We therefore concludes that CT-guided NCPB with alcohol is an effective and safe modality in the management of intractable pancreatic cancer pain. These results indicate CPB does not directly improve QOL in patients with pancreatic cancer pain, but it may prevent deterioration in QOL by the long-lasting analgesic effect, limitation of side effects and the reduction of morphine consumption, compared to treatment only with NSAID-morphine. The results suggest that intraoperative chemical splanchnicectomy with alcohol significantly reduces or prevents pain in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. NCPB was associated with a reduction in analgesic drug administration and drug-related adverse effects, representing an effective tool in the treatment of pancreatic cancer pain. Although NCPB improves pain relief in patients with pancreatic cancer vs optimized systemic analgesic therapy alone, it does not affect QOL or survival."

232,CD005538,"The nurses underestimated the pain experienced by the child. The substance may augment the therapeutic options if injected slowly and after suitable prophylaxis to avoid postoperative nausea and vomiting. Given the necessarily invasive nature of caudal block, we suggest the combined use of diclofenac suppository with local anesthetic infiltration at port sites as a useful and more economical alternative for analgesia following pediatric laparoscopy. Voltarol appears to be the better pre-emptive analgesic for dental extractions under general anaesthesia when compared with paracetamol and no analgesia. We advocate the use of laparoscopy for the diagnosis and treatment of dysplastic kidney with ectopic ureter. Comparative analysis of the efficiency of postoperative analgesia of the above agents has indicated that diclofenac and paracetamol have a sufficient analgesic activity and at the same time do not show the adverse reactions unique to narcotic analgesics. The proportion experiencing moderately severe to severe pain on returning to the ward, as their maximum pain score and pain score at discharge fell from 70 per cent to 48 per cent, 85 per cent to 56 per cent, and six per cent to two per cent respectively. Early recognition of the disease is important to remove possible aetiologic agents and to treat them before chronic lesions are present to avoid long-term renal damage. A comparative analysis of the efficiency of postoperative analgesia by the discussed drugs showed that diclofenac possesses a sufficient analgetic activity and is free of any side-effects inherent in narcotic analgetics. S(+)-ketamine combined with a plain bupivacaine caudal provides no better analgesia than caudal bupivacaine alone, indicating that the principal analgesic effect of caudal S(+)-ketamine results from a local neuroaxial rather than a systemic effect. Our findings suggest that this combined regimen may be a promising prophylactic approach to postoperative pain control in children undergoing ophthalmological surgery. The pre-operative rectal administration of diclofenac for pain relief after adenotomy is safe and effective. Copyright 2000 The British Infection Society. Suppository is reserved for children when oral intake is not possible, and injection should be the last resort. It was therefore concluded that intravenous diclofenac given intra-operatively has analgesic effect in the immediate post-operative period and it is recommended for small children during adenoidectomy. in 1992 revealed that four of the 73 patients (5.5%) receiving diclofenac at induction of anaesthesia suffered reactionary haemorrhage requiring operative control, as compared with two of 293 (0.7%) receiving other analgesics. Preemptive diclofenac given rectally reduced pain intensity and morphine requirements of children anaesthetized with remifentanil for tonsillectomy. The results suggest that sublingual morphine may be a suitable alternative to various other routes of opioid administration in children, but further investigations of the sublingual route of administration of opioids in children are required. Adverse effects and duration of PCA were comparable in the four groups. This property of clonidine indicates that it may be superior to other sedative premedicants such as diazepam and midazolam. The study points out that immediate postoperative comfort obtained by prophylactic analgesia needs to be followed by analgesics given on a continuous basis for the first days after surgery. These two drugs are suitable for short-term analgesia-based sedation in pediatric postoperative ICU patients. It would appear that the combination of a caudal block and rectal diclofenac in children undergoing minor lower abdominal surgery reduces the need for subsequent analgesia. Key points in the management of anaesthesia in KGS are discussed. This study indicates that diclofenac was no more effective than high-dose acetaminophen (90 mg vs. 60 mg kg(-1) 24 h(-1)) for analgesia, but resulted in a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients following tonsillectomy. RF appears to be a safe and reliable method for tonsil surgery with much less postoperative morbidity than regular TE. No serious adverse events were observed. A single intramuscular dose of diclofenac significantly reduces the need for an opioid analgesic in children after inguinal herniotomy or orchidopexy, and owing to its long duration of action, it offers an alternative or complementary method of pain relief to caudal analgesia. There were no significant differences in sedation score between the group of patients who received analgesics and the group of those who did not, and many patients had satisfactory sedation scores in the surgical ward, suggesting that appropriate administration of postoperative analgesics is possible. In both treatment groups there was an association between bleeding and restlessness during recovery so the increased bleeding in the diclofenac group may not be a direct effect. According to the results the preventive analgesia method reduces significantly the postoperative pain and anxiety, which makes the administration of additional analgetics advisable and cuts the child's stay in one-day hospital. glycopyrrolate before the induction of anaesthesia significantly reduced the scores for salivation. In common with the experience of others, it is possible to perform tonsillectomies safely on a same-day basis. This pharmacokinetic profile renders diclofenac suppository a suitable formulation for short duration surgery. nalbuphine or diclofenac suppositories compared with control. Rectal diclofenac is a useful alternative to caudal blockade in this group of patients. Improved oral intake resulted in a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting and allowed safer and earlier hospital discharge. Diclofenac may offer advantages compared to papaveretum with regard to safety and convenience for use in the treatment of pain after tonsillectomy in children. Codeine analgesia is less reliable than morphine, but was not well correlated with either phenotype or plasma morphine in this study. Subjects in Group L required significantly more doses of postoperative analgesia than those in Group C (p < 0.05). Copyright 2004 Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Acceptable pain scores may be achieved by the administration of regular analgesia to these patients. This, combined with supplemental oral paracetamol, obviates the need for opiates, resulting in alert infants who feed well and are suitable for early discharge. The efficacy of diclofenac 0.5 mg x kg(-1) and paracetamol 15 mg x kg(-1) as oral analgesic premedication for BMT was comparable in children receiving an anaesthetic which included intraoperative administration of fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1). Premedication with a small dose of ketamine reduces swallowing-evoked pain after tonsillectomy in children who received an analgesic regimen combining an opioid and a NSAID. Vt and total plasma clearance were higher than in adults but the elimination half-life was similar. The various pharmaceutical presentations and the availability as a noncontrolled substance may make it a useful addition to paediatric anaesthesia if it becomes licensed for paediatric anaesthesia in the UK. The rate of recovery in children after exposure to desflurane was faster than those patients receiving isoflurane; recovery from desflurane, but not isoflurane, was relatively unaffected by the duration of anaesthesia. Parental follow-up questionnaires for the subsequent two days showed no difference in measured parameters between the groups. This is the first case report on colon perforation occurring in an adolescent (16-year-old girl) after short-term diclofenac intake. There were no significant differences between the two drugs in respect of time to awaken from anaesthesia or incidence of postoperative vomiting. Rectal diclofenac was not effective as a single analgesic as compared to other techniques. The median pain scores (2 at 15 min and 1 at 30 min postoperatively) were the same in both groups. The incidence of postoperative haemorrhage and vomiting was low. Children who received the rectal diclofenac-paracetamol combination experienced a lower pain scale and a decreased need for morphine compared with children receiving each drug alone. The subpubic penile block provided significantly better analgesia than the subcutaneous ring block of the penis. The pain scores in the diclofenac with fentanyl group were significantly lower at one h and four h than the group receiving diclofenac alone (P = 0.008 and 0.02 respectively). Administration of rescue anti-emetics, pain scores in recovery and pain scores over the next 24 h were similar between the two groups. Apart from more vomiting with halothane and more discomfort during the first 10 min after awakening with sevoflurane, the quality of recovery was similar with the two anaesthestics."
233,CD004604,"In study patients with moderate to severe pain after dental surgery, rofecoxib 50 mg had a greater analgesic effect than oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg and was associated with less nausea and vomiting. More information is required to confirm efficacy in postsurgical pain. AZD3582 750 mg had similar analgesic efficacy as equimolar doses of naproxen, but noninferiority to rofecoxib was not demonstrated. Patients treated with a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg achieved an overall analgesic effect at least as effective as patients treated with a single-dose of oxycodone/acetaminophen 10/650 mg over 6 h and multidose oxycodone/acetaminophen over 24 h, with fewer adverse experiences of nausea (p < 0.001), vomiting (p < 0.01), and dizziness (p < 0.001). Rofecoxib provided superior analgesic efficacy compared with codeine/acetaminophen with fewer gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events. These results support the hypothesis that the analgesic effects of NSAIDs primarily derive from inhibition of COX-2. In this study of moderate to severe postoperative dental pain, the analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was greater than that of codeine/acetaminophen, with a lower incidence of adverse events and nausea. Compared with 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (50 mg every 8 hours), a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg provided greater overall analgesic efficacy over 24 hours. Rofecoxib 50 mg once daily effectively treated post-orthopedic surgery pain. Rofecoxib has a longer duration of action as a single dose and gave adequate analgesia for over half of that study group; patients in the dexketoprofen trometamol group needed more rescue analgesia. The overall analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was generally similar to that of ibuprofen 400 mg, except for a significantly longer duration of analgesic effect. Lumiracoxib 400 mg provides rapid, effective and sustained relief of post-operative dental pain, comparable or superior to rofecoxib. This study demonstrates that valdecoxib provides significantly greater analgesic efficacy than rofecoxib in the management of pain after oral surgery. The limited efficacy of rofecoxib in this study contrasts to the results of previous surgical studies evaluating rofecoxib, and may be partially explained by the postoperative dosing in this arthroscopic surgical model. We concluded that rofecoxib was efficacious in the treatment of postoperative dental pain and that COX-2-derived prostanoids play a role in treatment of the pain associated with dental surgery. All study medications were generally well tolerated. Thus rofecoxib provided analgesic efficacy superior to that of celecoxib and comparable to that of ibuprofen in the treatment of patients with acute postoperative dental pain. Whether this is relevant for short-term use is unknown, but it has to be considered before rofecoxib may be used for pain relief following third molar surgery. All active treatments were well tolerated. All treatments were well tolerated."

235,CD003668,"We conclude that the prone position may offer an advantage over the supine position in the management of extremely immature infants with chronic lung disease before and after feeding. These results suggest that prone position is a safe and beneficial procedure during weaning from mechanical ventilation and may contribute to weaning success in preterm infants. The prone position could decrease energy expenditure for spontaneous breathing and may shorten the period of ventilatory support for very low birthweight infants with CLD. We conclude that placing the stable VLBW mechanically ventilated infant in a side-lying position has no deleterious effects on oxygenation and ventilation, as measured by tcPO2 and tcPCO2, and therefore should be encouraged. This may conserve energy and decrease complications of hypoxia for sick preterm infants. This suggest that short-term lateral positioning as well as supine positioning can be utilized without deleterious effects on pulmonary mechanics and gas exchange in neonates recovering from respiratory distress syndrome. The mechanism and clinical applicability of such observations need to be explored further. We conclude that oxygenation in infants with unilateral lung disease is best with the good lung uppermost--the reverse of what has been observed in adults. The results indicate that changing a neonate's position does not significantly alter transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension."
236,CD002911,"In France, the alarm device is not reimbursed by the national health service and therefore is poorly accepted, as suggested from the high rate of patients lost to follow-up. The 10 children who terminated treatment prematurely had lower self-esteem and more parent-reported conduct problems than the 40 children who completed treatment. Such findings indicate that the body-worn alarm could become the treatment of choice for nocturnal enuresis. We conclude that there may be mental health benefits in children helped to master the symptom of enuresis, which in this age group is probably a chronic stressor. The enuresis tolerance scale was found to be a highly significant predictor of early termination from conditioning treatment. No advantages were observed with the combination of Alarm and desmopressin in our protocol. Alarms took several weeks to produce a benefit, which was persistent on follow-up. Frequent follow-up with emotional support and encouragement appear to be important components of an efficacious intervention for children with nocturnal enuresis. However, both treatment modalities have a low long-term success rate of 36% to 37%. It is proposed that the contiguous alarm is the treatment of choice at the present time because of its significantly lower rate of malfunction. These findings indicate that better results are seen with the Mozes Detector than with imipramine in older children with primary nocturnal enuresis. Arousal Training is the treatment of choice for non-clinical enuretic children between 6 and 12 years of age. The combination of desmopressin and alarm was particularly helpful for children with severe wetting and those with family and behavioural problems. However, both groups improved significantly as compared with the expected sponaneous cessation of bedwetting. Parents of children who received the special diet, because they were unimpressed by the rate of improvement, would not permit their children to continue this form of therapy for longer than 1 or 2 months. Maternal anger was associated with a greater drop-out rate. Similar rates of success were achieved for 47 children, aged 6 to 12 years, who partially or totally completed the 3-month period of alarm use. The combined treatment of desmopressin and alarm showed 5.1 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SEM) dry nights per week and resulted in significantly more dry nights per week during the 2 weeks of observation than placebo and alarm (4.1 +/- 0.4, P less than 0.05). Therefore, we infer that in partial or nonresponders, desmopressin does not enhance learning. When this fails or when a safe drug with rapid effect is needed, however, desmopressin is a useful alternative. This study indicates that enuresis in children can be successfully managed with a short duration outpatient program."
237,CD004074,"Iron stores and Hb in infancy can be improved in neonates born to anemic mothers by delaying cord clamping at birth. The effect of delayed clamping was significantly greater for infants born to mothers with low ferritin at delivery, breastfed infants not receiving iron-fortified milk or formula, and infants born with birthweight between 2500 g and 3000 g. A cord clamping delay of 2 minutes increased 6-month iron stores by about 27-47 mg. Delay in cord clamping of 2 minutes could help prevent iron deficiency from developing before 6 months of age, when iron-fortified complementary foods could be introduced. It is a safe, simple and low cost delivery procedure that should be incorporated in integrated programmes aimed at reducing iron deficiency anaemia in infants in developing countries. Overall the trial provides no clear evidence for the benefit of early cord clamping (the current policy as part of the active management of the third stage in the UK) on the outcomes considered. Iron stores at 3 months in term infants are not influenced by timing of cord clamping at birth. Our results suggest that the Leboyer procedure has no advantage over a gentle, conventional delivery in influencing infant and maternal outcomes. This simple, free and safe delivery procedure might offer a strategy to reduce early infant anaemia risk, when other interventions are not yet feasible."
238,CD002760,"Ibuprofen is an appropriate analgesic for treating post-operative dental pain. In conclusion, ibuprofen produced better analgesia than dihydrocodeine with significantly fewer adverse effects and is therefore a better choice for pain relief after oral surgery. Non-parametric statistical tests indicated highly significant correlations between single- and multiple-dose analgesic measurements for both zomepirac and dihydrocodeine."

241,CD001896,"These results suggest that uterosacral nerve interruption may prove an effective alternative treatment for this menstrual disorder. Presacral neurectomy should be combined with conservative surgery for endometriosis only in selected cases. Our results suggest that LUNA may decrease postoperative ischemic pain and improve dysmenorrhea associated with uterine myomas treated by LBCUV. Insertion of an Lng-IUD after laparoscopic surgery for symptomatic endometriosis significantly reduced the medium-term risk of recurrence of moderate or severe dysmenorrhea. LPSN is a valid option for treating primary dysmenorrhea. Presacral neurectomy improves the cure rate in women who are treated with conservative laparoscopic surgery for severe dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis. We speculate that the most common reasons for failure of presacral neurectomy are inappropriate selection of patients and incomplete resection of the presacral nerve plexus."
242,CD007124,"In conclusion, controlled release formulations provide more steady serum concentrations of carbamazepine along with better tolerability. We conclude that greater stability in serum CBZ and CBZE concentrations can be obtained by using an SR of CBZ, without reducing the bioavailability of the drug. Substituting one formulation for the other did not cause patients to have a significant change in seizure frequency. By using Neurotol slow instead of a conventional CBZ preparation, Tegretol, it is evidently possible to reduce the dosing frequency from 3 times a day to twice daily administrations. The mean total number of seizures was approximately four per week and did not differ between the two treatments, but during the last 2 weeks of the study period the occurrence of seizures was significantly smaller during SR (P = 0.02). regimen. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) In conclusion, a slow-release preparation of CBZ can render fewer side effects than conventional CBZ preparations. The results of the repeated test procedure show that the smoothing effect of the CR condition on serum concentration fluctuations results in a more stable pattern of cognitive functioning during the day."

244,CD002208,"Whereas previous studies indicated effectiveness of methadone-assisted detoxification and high-dose maintenance programs in reducing mortality, the present study findings suggest that low-threshold maintenance programs also reduce overdose mortality, with higher dosages being most protective. We suggest the need for a reappraisal of the goals and procedures of methadone reduction treatment. The high-dose group had significantly greater decreases in illicit opioid use. Independent of patient characteristics, retention improved dramatically in the first years of programme functioning, suggesting that patient retention is a sensitive indicator of programme performance. Lifetime sedative dependence was associated with significantly better retention, decreased rates of cocaine-positive urine samples, and increased rates of cocaine abstinence; among buprenorphine- but not methadone-maintained patients, it was also associated with increased rates of abstinence from illicit opioids. The more 'humane' clinic policy later in the decade is likely to have increased retention and reduced illicit drug use also. It is concluded that, in order to minimize heroin addicts' risk of death, they should be offered indefinite, high-dose methadone maintenance. More attention should be paid to the effect of staff attitudes and beliefs on the effectiveness of maintenance treatment. There are no apparent health risks associated with long-term buprenorphine maintenance at this dosage. Dose of methadone > 80 mg/day, age > 30 years, living with family or stable partner and non-current use of alcohol were significant predictive variables for retention. When combined, they did not dramatically enhance each other's effects on any 1 outcome measure, but they did seem to have complementary benefits. Both methyadyl acetate and high-dose methadone appear to be better maintenance regimens than low-dose methadone under the conditions of this study. Doses as low as 20 mg may improve retention but are inadequate for suppressing illicit drug use. In this study, with flexible dosing and patient participation in dose decisions, patients were retained on methadone about as well as was reported in a previous study with patients on a fixed dose of 80 mg. Buprenorphine was as effective as methadone, 60 mg/d, and both were superior to methadone, 20 mg/d, in reducing illicit opioid use and maintaining patients in treatment for 25 weeks. Patients in maintenance-oriented clinics were 30% more likely to remain in treatment than those in abstinence-oriented centres."
245,CD001419,"This study indicates that the use of single-agent doxorubicin as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has no significant clinical benefit in patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcoma. A reduced-dose chemotherapy regimen was found to be comparable to the high-dose regimen. These preliminary data suggest that adjuvant Adriamycin not be used outside the confines of a clinical trial such as the current intergroup adjuvant sarcoma study. Experience from this study has been used to plan a trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin/ifosfamide, which is currently in progress. Because control patients do well, a very large study is required to define the role of adjuvant doxorubicin. Recent improvement in the survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas is not necessarily a result of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Thus, the use of chemotherapy when combined with aggressive local measures appears to improve disease-free survival, but additional patients and longer follow-up are necessary to determine if improved overall survival will result. Thus, we could not show a benefit for this dose schedule of Adriamycin as adjuvant treatment for uterine sarcomas. These preliminary observations encourage continuation of the study."
246,CD001018,"Further clinical trials are necessary to determine whether these favorable biochemical effects are associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) may influence somatometric GH correlation patterns too. It also shows that low-dose vitamin D supplementation has only a minor effect in the prevention of osteoporosis in non-osteoporotic early postmenopausal women and does not give any benefit additional to that of HRT alone. Physical fitness levels increased in the exercise groups, but not in the control group or the estrogen-alone treated women. Provera does not adversely affect the lipid profile. These findings show that all three treatments are effective in the prevention of postmenopausal loss of bone mass. Plasma fasting homocysteine concentrations are lowered by E2-dydrogesterone therapy in postmenopausal women. This observation provides important insights into the metabolic effects of postmenopausal hormones but is insufficient to recommend the use of hormones for secondary prevention of heart disease. This 4-year randomized study showed an additive effect of etidronate and HRT on hip and spine BMD in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. The possible dyslipidemic effect of cholecalciferol, along with the risk of hypercalcemia, emphasizes the caution necessary in cholecalciferol treatment. The present study suggests that high-dose post-menopausal hormone therapy changes the body composition by increasing the muscle mass and that, since the body weight remains unchanged, a proportionate decrease in the fat mass seems to occur. HRT is effective in reducing elevated LDL cholesterol levels, and should be considered in the treatment of hyperlipidaemic postmenopausal women, in addition to dietary therapy. Hormone replacement therapy did not increase muscle performance, improve balance or reduce falls over a year in middle-aged women. This is the first study to demonstrate the effects of etidronate in early postmenopausal women, and the additive beneficial effects of HRT and ICE on bone mineral density. Moreover, the low frequency of bleeding with continuous oestrogen-progestogen therapy would make this an appropriate alternative in postmenopausal replacement therapy. Total serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were reduced by approximately 5% (P less than 0.01) and 8% (P less than 0.01), respectively, after 1 year of combined oestrogen-CPA therapy in comparison with both the initial values and the placebo group but serum triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol levels were unchanged in both groups. It is concluded that treatment with sequentially combined oestrogen and progestogen, using norethisterone acetate in combination with 17 beta-oestradiol in clinically relevant doses, does not produce any adverse effects on serum lipids or lipoproteins. Menopause is associated with a gain in fat mass and a loss of lean body mass, but these changes in body composition are not prevented by hormone replacement therapy. None of these factors significantly affected the observed overall relationships between estrogen and changes in girth. In conclusion, both regimens produce a clinically relevant decrease of fibrinogen levels; the continuous regimen affects also the levels of FVII and inhibitors suggesting that the haemostatic balance is shifted to a more physiological state. The findings of the present study suggest that some of the protective impact of postmenopausal hormone therapy on cardiovascular disease may be explained by the effect on body composition, in particular abdominal fat. The overall effect of NA-EE2 treatments on lipid measures was favorable. Our study provides conclusive evidence that hormone treatment does not produce weight gain in women during the menopause transition. This study demonstrates that this estradiol matrix transdermal delivery system is effective in the treatment of menopausal symptoms, while providing the skin tolerability desired by patients. The paradoxical changes of triglyceride and HDL might partly be explained by the effect of progestins used in this study. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD."
247,CD004081,"It is concluded that lignocaine jelly with the use of a spray significantly increases post-operative side-effects. Using lidocaine to inflate the ETT cuff decreases the severity of postoperative sore throat at one hour, and both the incidence and severity at 24 hours. This approach also decreases hemodynamic effects, restlessness, dysphonia, and hoarseness. There were no significant differences between the two groups, which suggests that topical anaesthesia of the mucosa of the upper airway is ineffective as a means of ameliorating airway complaints in connection with tracheal intubation. These data show benefits of using an alkalinized lidocaine-filled ETT cuff in combination with water-soluble gel lubrication in preventing post-intubation sore throat. A decrease in sore throat during the postoperative period was recorded when the cuff was inflated with a small dose of alkalinized lidocaine (i.e., 40 mg of L-HCl and 1.4% of NaHCO3) rather than with air when ventilation was controlled without N2O. Our findings also confirm that laryngo-tracheal lidocaine application does not prevent sore throat, hoarseness or dysphagia after total intravenous anaesthesia. Lidocaine was also effective in reducing of incidence and severity of sore throat after operation. The complications were more in the air group. In conclusion, intravenous lidocaine prior to endotracheal intubation decreased the incidence of postoperative sore throat and cough. Lidocaine, saline, and air had similar effects on postoperative sore throat. Thus, alkalinized lidocaine-filled ET cuffs seem to be safer than conventional air-filled ET cuffs. Using lidocaine to inflate the ETT cuff or IV lidocaine at the end of surgery decreases the frequency of postoperative cough and sore throat and would provide better outcome for patients and the physician."

251,CD006332,"Alvimopan alone accelerates colonic transit, suggesting that mu-opiate mechanisms participate in the physiologic control of colonic transit. Alvimopan (6 or 12 mg) accelerates GI recovery and is well tolerated in patients undergoing open laparotomy. The results show that the naloxone formulation counteracts the effect of codeine on intestinal transit, suggesting that it may have useful clinical applications. Oral methylnaltrexone may have a clinical value in the prevention and treatment of constipation induced by long-term opioid use. However, opioid withdrawal was observed and it is suggested that initial individual naloxone doses should not exceed 5 mg. Further research is needed into the oral absorption of naloxone, as well as further studies of clinical efficacy and dosing. Methylnaltrexone may be a useful adjunct to opioids for the relief of opioid-induced constipation. Alvimopan has a safety profile that is similar to that of placebo and provides significantly improved lower gastrointestinal recovery in women who undergo simple total abdominal hysterectomy. Alvimopan, a novel peripheral opioid mu-receptor antagonist, has demonstrated significant efficacy for the management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction without compromise of centrally mediated opioid-induced analgesia. Delayed gastrointestinal transit after nalbuphine is explained by agonist-like effects on peripheral opioid receptors in the gut. In patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, alvimopan accelerated gastrointestinal recovery and time to the hospital discharge order written compared with placebo and was well tolerated. Low-dosage methylnaltrexone may have clinical utility in managing opioid-induced constipation. Our results suggest that there is a prevailing direct and local luminal effect of enteric-coated methylnaltrexone and that the enteric-coated formulation exerts its gut pharmacologic actions more efficiently than the uncoated formulation. Our results provide evidence that the administration of enteral opioid antagonists in ventilated patients with opioid analgesia might be a simple-and possibly preventive-treatment of increased gastric tube reflux and reduces frequency of pneumonia. We conclude that ADL 8-2698 prevents morphine-induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affecting central opioid analgesia. Reduction of esophagogastral mucosal injury and reduced need for procinetic medication suggests an improvement of GI motility by enteral naloxone in fentanyl-treated, mechanically ventilated patients. Patients using high doses of opioids appear to be the most vulnerable to the analgesic effect of oral naloxone. Our results suggest that subcutaneous methylnaltrexone may have clinical utility in treating opioid-induced constipation and reducing opioid-induced unpleasant subjective symptoms. Alvimopan accelerated GI recovery and time to hospital discharge order written compared with placebo in patients undergoing laparotomy and was well tolerated. Epidural naloxone reduces epidural morphine-induced intestinal hypomotility without reversing its analgesic effects. Selective inhibition of gastrointestinal opioid receptors by an antagonist with limited oral absorption that does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier speeds recovery of bowel function and shortens the duration of hospitalization. Methylnaltrexone may have the potential to decrease the side effects of opioid medications, which are mediated peripherally, while maintaining the central analgesia effect of the opioid."
252,CD007293,"The findings of this study have broad applicability, because the sample is representative of the population existing in numerous social and healthcare settings; they are of value for administrative purposes, because they may be taken as reference in resource allocation plans; and they have medicolegal implications, as the resulting conduct of healthcare providers is supported by a rigorous scientific study. Routine medical testing before cataract surgery does not measurably increase the safety of the surgery. The results also suggest it would be more efficient not to request routine preoperative tests unless indicated by patient history or physical examination."
253,CD001874,"These results suggest that pre-operative infiltration of 0.25% bupivacaine has no beneficial pre-emptive analgesic action compared to both an identical treatment administered after tonsillectomy and a placebo. We conclude that bupivacaine is a safe medication but offers no advantage in the control of early postoperative pain in adult patients undergoing local tonsillectomy. We conclude that glossopharyngeal block does not improve analgesia following tonsillectomy although there is short-lived benefit following uvulopalatoplasty. The efficacy of benzydamine hydrochloride (Difflam) spray to relieve pain from postoperative tonsillectomy was assessed, but it was found that it did not relieve the symptoms after operation when compared to matching placebo. These results suggest that the timing of peritonsillar infiltration with bupivacaine is not of clinical importance and does not affect the quality of postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing tonsillectomy."

255,CD009593,"A higher proportion of total equivocal results were obtained for the MTD assay, at 10.5% (17/162), while the Xpert MTB/RIF assay generated 5.5% (9/162) of invalid reads. Performance in patients infected with HIV, especially those with advanced immunosuppression, warrants further study. (Funded by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics.) Both molecular assays are suitable for the detection of M. tuberculosis isolates in smear-positive pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens, while the sensitivity of the detection of M. tuberculosis isolates in smear-negative specimens was variable. Moreover, the MTB/RIF test provided sensitive detection of tuberculosis in less than two hours. In conclusion, this highly sensitive and simple-to-use system can detect M. tuberculosis directly from sputum in less than 2 h. Further evaluation in high burden TB and HIV areas under programmatic health care settings to ascertain applicability, cost-effectiveness, robustness and local acceptance are required. Xpert should be further explored as a surrogate measurement for sputum mycobacterial load. Overall agreement compared to culture was 89% (98% for smear positives and 72% for smear negatives) for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. The GeneXpert assay was highly effective for tuberculosis diagnosis and identification of rifampin-resistant strains in smear-negative samples. Although the test is validated only for respiratory samples, our findings suggest that it could be useful for the diagnosis of extra-pulmonary TB. These characteristics render it a promising close-to-patient test for TB in various settings. GX offers high potential for the diagnosis of tuberculosis due to its capacity for direct detection of MTC, its rapidity, and its simplicity. However, despite the ability of the assay to rapidly detect rifampicin-resistant disease, the specificity for drug-resistant TB was sub-optimal. The test appeared to be as sensitive as culture with smear-positive specimens but less sensitive with smear-negative pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens that include low numbers of bacilli."

257,CD001431,"Future research should focus on the merits of these alternate approaches for subgroups of individuals with different backgrounds who are being counseled in the variety of settings where BRCA1 testing is likely to be offered. It is concluded that tailored decision aids prepare women for decision making better than do general pamphlets. The preferences of patients with prostate cancer in the choice of treatment may differ from the priorities of the physicians. Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. However, factors other than provision of information must determine their CRC screening preferences. The results of this study have implications for future DA design, and other areas where patient Kn and understanding are important, such as in the setting of informed consent. A decision aid consisting of an educational video, brochure, and chart marker increased ordering and performance of colon cancer screening tests. Whether shared decision making is the ideal model and how to measure its occurrence are subjects for further research. Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The study suggests that well-informed women adopting an active role may counteract physicians' emphasis on newly introduced treatments. Overall, the video was significantly more effective than the Internet in educating participants about benefits and risks of PSA screening. Results are discussed in terms of contextual factors and individual differences as moderators of treatment decision aid effectiveness. Public Web sites about prostate cancer provide less effective decision support than a specially designed Internet decision aid. (c) 2008 American Cancer Society. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00345449). Despite the low overall vaccine acceptance rate, it is concluded that individualized decision analysis can influence the clinical decisions taken by knowledgeable and interested patients. Further research is required to ascertain the utility of the decision aid during the consultation. The results of this pilot study justify future large-scale trials to determine the effectiveness of similar interventions. Strategies to match these patients' needs might improve compliance and long-term outcomes. Delivery of decision aids by clinicians during the visit improves knowledge and shows a trend toward better acceptability and less decisional conflict. Also, preconsultation education appears to be an effective clinical strategy for helping patients gain an accurate understanding of their treatment options before meeting with physicians. Providing women with information alone did not affect treatment choices; however, the addition of an interview to clarify values and elicit preferences had a significant effect on women's management and resulted in reduced costs. Its impact on costs of care depends on the proportion of patients with various diagnoses and on local surgery rates. Efforts to broadly implement decision aids may need to offer a variety of approaches, and incorporate creative strategies to enhance reaching all population subgroups. There was short-term improvement in the appropriateness of antithrombotic care among patients with NVAF who were exposed to a decision aid, but the improvement did not persist. A PDA regarding the use of NHPs for menopausal symptoms impacted favourably on women's decisional conflict, but was not superior to a general information brochure on menopause. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc. These findings should be replicated in studies with a larger sample size and patients at overall higher risk of CHD. Incorporating the PSA videotape into the periodic health examination for asymptomatic men aged 50 years and older is recommended. This trial demonstrates that, among patients facing a real treatment decision, interventions to inform patients about hypertension and to clarify patients' values concerning outcomes of treatment are effective in reducing decisional conflict and increasing patient knowledge, while not resulting in any increases in state anxiety. Trial Registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN84367722. The next stage is to explore strategies to make it available to all appropriate patients. The decision aid is an effective and acceptable strategy for patient education to facilitate an inclusive and informed decision-making process about managing ovarian cancer risk. Such subgroups should be identified, and appropriate decision support interventions should be developed and evaluated. These findings suggest that theoretically designed interventions can be effective in helping women understand their cancer risk and appropriate risk assessment options and can be implemented successfully within a service program like the CIS. Further work needs to examine ways to enhance women's power in decision-making within the doctor-patient relationship. Compared to pamphlets, DAs appear to improve the agreement between women's and physicians' decisional conflict about HRT. The presentation of video images appears to be a valuable information source for conveying treatment options to patients, but caution may be needed to prevent elevated or possibly unrealistic treatment expectations. Decision aids may emerge as a useful tool to facilitate SDM and evidence-based clinical practice. Women made more informed decisions when provided with an evidence-based decision-aid leaflet preceding a routine consultation about choices of termination method. Further study is needed to specifically determine effects in those changing the status quo and on the quality of patient-practitioner communication and persistence with decisions. These results suggest that this computer program has the potential to stand alone as an educational intervention for low-risk women but should be used as a supplement to genetic counseling for those at high risk.

As barriers to implementing computer-based patient decision support programs decrease, alternative models for delivering these programs should be explored. Supporting decision making in a systematic way using trade-offs is beneficial for these women. The developed decision aid improved patient outcomes better than a control pamphlet when implemented during genetic counseling and given to the patient to take home. Decision aids are an effective decision-support strategy for women considering genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk, and are most effective before the patient has made a decision, which is generally at the point of having blood drawn. When making decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy, patients with early breast cancer who had been exposed to the Decision Board had better knowledge of the disease and treatment options and greater satisfaction with their decision making than those who received the standard consultation. The use of web based technology would reduce the cost of the intervention. Such instruments should be considered by surgeons when communicating the different surgical options to women with breast cancer. Such programmes could be delivered cheaply by the internet, and there are good arguments for coordinated investment in them, particularly for conditions in which patient utilities are important. The six-step approach to decision making was more helpful than the SOGC's information document in increasing subjects' knowledge of the risks and benefits of HRT, in creating more realistic expectations of HRT, and in increasing the congruence between subjects' personal values and their decisions on HRT. The tendency for the decision choices and knowledge scores to return to baseline at follow-up suggests the need for initial and ongoing prevention decision support. As immunization schedules increase in complexity and parents are asked to make more choices, videotaped information may be a better method to achieve the goal of truly informed consent. Providing patients with balanced information may not be sufficient to alter the decision-making process. Colorectal Web is more effective than a standard colorectal cancer Web site at prompting previously unscreened individuals to choose a preferred colorectal cancer screening test and to be screened for colorectal cancer. For physicians who offer the PSA as a screening test, this finding highlights the importance of apprising patients of the associated benefits, burdens, and uncertainties and allowing them to participate in the screening decision. Women will adhere to their own plans, suggesting that consumer rather than provider plans may be the more appropriate gold standard for measuring adherence. A computerized decision aid, used outside of the primary care consultation, is effective in increasing patient involvement in decision making in primary care. Our EB booklet facilitated informed choice, even among "passive" decision-makers. Resources are not equivalent in achieving these outcomes. In a pilot study, a multicriteria-based patient decision aid for colorectal cancer screening improved patients' decision-making processes but had no effect on the implementation of screening plans. The DA is an effective way to assist women to make a decision about continuing mammography screening and seems to be a feasible intervention within a population screening program. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the acceptability and impact of decision aids in other clinical settings. Further efforts are required to evaluate the efficacy of such an intervention in other community urology clinics. When used in a primary care setting, an illustrated pamphlet decision-aid was effective in increasing knowledge of prostate cancer screening tests but did not change the use of these tests. The incremental benefit of a complex versus simpler decision-aid for post-menopausal women remains to be established prior to widespread dissemination of interactive computer-based HT decision-aids. Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society. A tailored prenatal testing decision aid plays an important role in improving women's knowledge of first and second trimester screening tests and assisting them to make decisions about screening and diagnostic tests that are consistent with their values. The benefit of an interactive digital education aid is expected to be higher in a broad-based practice setting outside of a comprehensive cancer center. (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved. The IHD SDP patients were more knowledgeable, underwent less revascularization (interventional therapies), and demonstrated increased patient decision-making autonomy without apparent impact on quality of life. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00388050. Prostate cancer screening use may be influenced by exposure to decision education and the influence of screening-related primary care practice factors. Before there is wide-spread dissemination of this technology, advocates should demonstrate its effectiveness in everyday practice. This study has shown unique benefits with each type of intervention such that women and their partners preferred individual genetic counseling, while they learned best in group-counseling sessions, and experienced the least decisional conflict regarding genetic testing with a decision aid. These data suggest that decision aids may not lead to more 'sharing' in treatment decision-making and that, in their current form, they may take too long to negotiate for use in routine primary care."
258,CD006033,"Both combined oral contraceptives exert a similar positive influence on bone turnover and bone-sparing effect in young postadolescent women. There was no significant effect on achieving maximum bone mass in young women. The present study suggests that the two COCs could exert a similar positive effect on bone turnover in young postadolescent women, without any significant and appreciable modification of BMD. DMPA-SC is an effective and well-tolerated contraceptive option, providing comparable efficacy and BMD safety to DMPA-IM. Our results suggest that estrogen supplementation is protective of bone in adolescent girls who receive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections. Since contraception with a pill containing the lowest estrogen dose is associated with the lowest incidence of side effects, these findings further suggest a pill containing 20 microg EE2 for young post-adolescent women would be the best choice. Results must be interpreted cautiously until it is determined whether these effects endure or are reversible. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. The findings suggest an increase in bone density during treatment with levonorgestrel and stable values during short-term administration of DMPA, in standard clinical doses for contraception. Prospective studies are required to determine the long-term effects of this continuous COC regimen. Women of 19-43 years of age using either one of the implants showed lower BMD at 18 months of use at the midshaft of the ulna, however, without a difference at the distal radius. Our study suggests that the skeletal effects of OC preparations may be influenced by progestogenic components in young women. Mesigyna proved to be a highly effective and low risk agent for premenopausal users. Both combined oral contraceptives exert a similar positive influence on bone turnover in young postadolescent women. Biochemical markers provided evidence for a reduced bone resorption. These data support the view that the likely cause of DMPA-associated bone loss is estrogen deficiency and demonstrate that it can be arrested by estrogen replacement therapy."
259,CD005508,"Thus as the peripheral arterial disease became more severe and extensive, beta-blockade, irrespective of its type, lost its hemodynamic effect on lower limb circulation. This may have been due to beta blockade plus reduced vascular resistance, which might also explain the reported adverse effects of pindolol and labetalol on claudication. Thus, in patients with intermittent claudication antihypertensives should be used with care. We conclude that despite evidence of beta 1-adrenergic blockade and a lowering of arterial pressure, neither beta-adrenergic blocker adversely affected the peripheral circulation."

261,CD006447,"Parental presence during induction of anesthesia enhanced the effect of oral midazolam on emergence behavior of children undergoing general anesthesia. Depending on the music therapist, interactive music therapy may relieve anxiety on separation and entrance to the operating room but appears less effective during the induction of anesthesia. The family-centered preoperative ADVANCE preparation program is effective in the reduction of preoperative anxiety and improvement in postoperative outcomes. Children are less anxious and show increased compliance during induction when exposed to a single care-provider in a dimmed, quiet operating room with background music. Parents who accompanied their children to the operating room, however, were less anxious and more satisfied. Under the conditions of this study, oral midazolam is more effective than either parental presence or no intervention for managing a child's and parent's anxiety during the preoperative period. Decreasing the parent's level of anxiety preoperatively may have a positive effect on the child's level of anxiety expressed postoperatively. Children who were older than 4 yr or those with a parent with a low trait anxiety or who had a low baseline level of activity/temperament benefited from parental presence during induction. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Children of mothers who underwent acupuncture intervention benefitted from the reduction of maternal anxiety during the induction of anesthesia. Distraction in a pleasurable and familiar activity provides anxiety relief, probably through cognitive and motor absorption. We discuss reasons for the lack of treatment effects from parental presence, and new directions for future research to identify subgroups of children who may most benefit from the opportunity to have parents involved in the perioperative period. Furthermore, the reduction in need for information score in the intervention group indicates that preoperative videos may be a useful tool for providing parents with information. However, no increased incidence of electrocardiogram abnormalities were found in parents present during induction of anesthesia. It alleviates preoperative anxiety, especially during induction of anesthesia and reduces behavioral disorders during the first postoperative week. We would encourage the promotion of this form of distraction therapy in the treatment of children requiring surgery, but the resistance of medical personnel make it very difficult to insert this program in the activity of the operating room. The computer preparation package facilitated coping behavior in children undergoing DGA induction."

264,CD002113,"These prognostic criteria offer nursing staff a cost-effective method for selecting the most responsive patients for prompted-voiding treatment. Trainees with a high frequency of incontinence during baseline, the more cognitively intact residents, and residents with normal bladder capacity responded better to this behavior therapy program. The results are discussed in view of the management issues inherent in nursing home settings. The cost of implementing these labor-intensive interventions for frail nursing home residents will have to be justified based on functional and quality-of-life outcomes and are unlikely to be offset by savings in medical care costs in this population. Translating these positive benefits achieved under research conditions into practice will be challenging because of the implications of the intervention for staff workload and thereby the costs of care. The PV intervention resulted in clinically significant reductions in urinary incontinence for many of the participants, which may be achievable for many cognitively impaired homebound older adults."
265,CD000123,"When treated with atorvastatin, patients with peripheral arterial disease may experience improvement in symptoms to complement the anticipated reduction in cardiovascular events reported in other studies of statins. The present study demonstrates a beneficial effect of policosanol in patients with intermittent claudication. This suggests that red cell deformability is of minor importance in the arterial blood flow in the legs of these patients. This study, the first randomised controlled trial of its type, provides evidence that effective treatment of hyperlipidaemia favourably influences the natural history of symptomatic peripheral atherosclerosis. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Bezafibrate has no effect on the incidence of coronary heart disease and of stroke combined but may reduce the incidence of non-fatal coronary events, particularly in those aged <65 years at entry, in whom all coronary events may also be reduced. Compared with the fifteen control patients (treated with placebo), the fifteen patients treated with Sulodexide showed a significant decrease in blood triglycerides and fibrinogen as well as a significantly increased HDL-cholesterol, and positive instrumental changes: at the end of treatment Peak and Rest Flow values--and consequently also Winsor's index--were significantly increased only in patients treated with Sulodexide.

268,CD003005,"Caudal analgesia, with or without the addition of morphine, did not confer any advantage over injected diamorphine, and did not justify the extra time, risk and expense required to carry it out. Caudal analgesia is shown to be significantly better than morphine by means of a linear analogue scale designed to quantify behaviour immediately after operation. It is concluded that DNB provides satisfactory analgesia following circumcision and has specific advantages when compared with caudal analgesia. For 90 minutes following circumcision there was significantly less pain and caudal analgesia, but better pain relief could not be demonstrated following inguinal herniotomy and orchidopexy. Anesthesiologist preference should be the deciding factor in choosing one technique over the other. Incidence of adverse effects was the same in the two groups. Because of the higher incidence of side-effects and technique failure in the caudal group, dorsal nerve block is perhaps the preferred technique."
269,CD003794,"Budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (Symbicort) maintains the benefit of treatment optimisation, stabilising lung function and delaying exacerbations more effectively than either component drug alone or placebo. We conclude that FSC 250/50 decreases lung hyperinflation at rest and during exercise with an associated increase in exercise endurance time when compared with placebo. We conclude that FSC improved lung function and reduced the severity of dyspnea compared with individual components and placebo. The combination of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate has a broad spectrum of antiinflammatory effects in both current and former smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which may contribute to clinical efficacy. Treatment with FSC (FP, 250 microg, and SM, 50 microg) twice daily substantially improved morning lung function and sustained these improvements for over a period of 24 weeks compared with FP or SM treatment alone in patients with COPD, with no additional safety concerns for the combination treatment vs that with the individual components. SM&FP 50/250 microcg regularly assumed in combination via a single Diskus inhaler for a 52 week period improves respiratory function (such as FEV(1), morning PEF), and and symptom score significantly in moderate COPD previously treated with theophylline, and at an higher extent than SM alone or P. The use of beta(2) short acting prn is also reduced, together with the number of exacerbations. Because inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists and corticosteroid combination treatment produces better control of symptoms and lung function, with no greater risk of side-effects than that with use of either component alone, this combination treatment should be considered for patients with COPD. These results suggest a role for budesonide/formoterol in the long-term management of moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

271,CD001297,"In this study dosages of 100 IU and 200 IU daily of nasal sCT were insufficient to prevent bone loss during GnRH agonist treatment. Etidronate blocks bone mineral density changes associated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy and normalizes serum and urine indicators of bone turnover. The concomitant daily use of up to 2.45 mg of norethisterone does not eliminate the bone demineralization seen during GnRH agonist therapy with nafarelin in premenopausal women. We conclude that measuring individual biochemical bone markers can help to predict the bone effect of an increase in the circulating estradiol in women with ovarian deficiency. The add-back therapy protects women taking GnRHas from severe loss of BMD and accelerated bone collagen resorption, but reduces the efficacy of the GnRHa. Because treatment with buserelin, but not with danazol, was always associated with a significant decrease in BMC at L3, repeated usage of buserelin may lead to cumulative bone loss in patients with endometriosis. However, because this effect is attributable mainly to the activation of bone formation, it is not sufficient to eliminate bone loss induced by GnRH-a therapy. In the 3-monthly depot group, 13 women graded the tolerability of their treatment schedule as "good' compared with seven in the monthly depot group (chi 2 = 5.40, P = 0.02). The use of leuprolide acetate depot in combination with norethindrone acetate 5 mg alone, or with norethindrone acetate and conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg, provides effective suppression of pelvic pain symptoms associated with endometriosis while protecting against bone loss. The addition of HRT to GnRH-a for the treatment of endometriosis did not reduce the efficacy of treatment, and adverse hypoestrogenic effects were decreased, although not abolished. A significant correlation was demonstrated between mean serum oestradiol levels during treatment with nafarelin and the change in bone mineral (r = 0.655, P less than 0.005). Studies of larger numbers of patients followed for longer periods will be required to resolve the question of complete reversibility. Danazol maintained normoestrogenemia and increased bone mass with the gain maintained even 1 year after stopping therapy. It does not negate the therapeutic effect of GnRH-a on endometriosis. In conclusion, it appears that there is no extra advantage to patients with endometriosis being treated with goserelin in delaying the start of add-back therapy. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel Zoladex is as well tolerated and as effective as danazol in the treatment of premenopausal women with endometriosis. This study suggests that 1.25 mg CEE + 5 mg MA is effective in preventing hypoestrogenic side effects caused by GnRH-a, while the treatment of endometriosis is not impaired."

273,CD003219,"Further investigations are required to establish the role of nerve and tendon gliding exercises in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Our findings do not support the use of pyridoxine for treating carpal tunnel syndrome. The use of a magnet for reducing pain attributed to carpal tunnel syndrome was no more effective than use of the placebo device. Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd. This study provides added scientific evidence to support the efficacy of neutral wrist splints in CTS and suggests that physiologic improvement is best with full-time splint wear instructions. The results also indicate that the results of the electromyography/nerve conduction study (EMG/NCS) do not provide information about the subjects' likely response to splinting. Findings need to be confirmed, and ultrasound treatment will have to be compared with standard conservative and invasive treatment options. In this preliminary study, a yoga-based regimen was more effective than wrist splinting or no treatment in relieving some symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. There was no corresponding improvement in hand function or median nerve latency. These results provide evidence that keyboard users may experience a reduction in hand pain after several months of use of some alternative geometry keyboards. This study suggests that local insulin treatment may be of great potential benefit in the improvement of nerve functions in NIDDM patients with mild-to-moderate CTS who opt for conservative treatment. Although there was no statistically significant before-after difference in electrophysiologic studies, slightly decreased motor nerve conduction velocity and increased motor distal latency were noted in groups A and B, but not in group C. Ultrasound therapy in CTS was comparable to placebo ultrasound in providing symptomatic relief, and the probability of a negative effect on motor nerve conduction needs to be considered. For patients with mild to moderate CTS who opt for conservative treatment, corticosteroids are of greater benefit. This study also suggests that repeat electrodiagnostic testing is no more useful than clinical symptoms in deciding on surgical intervention after unsuccessful conservative therapy. Carpal tunnel syndrome associated with median nerve demyelination but not axonal degeneration may be treated with commonly used components of conservative medical or chiropractic care. This approach may provide a treatment alternative in the short-term, conservative management of CTS."
274,CD003385,"By this time it was also apparent that at posttreatment and at 6 months follow-up no benefit was being realized from combining cognitive-behavior therapy with desipramine. A two-stage medication intervention using fluoxetine adds modestly to the benefit of psychological treatment. Overall, the results favor the use of a combination of medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of bulimia nervosa, with medication continued for at least 24 weeks. Limitations to the study include the absence of a placebo pill group and a waiting list control group as well as a substantial dropout rate across all three treatment conditions. Of course, this study cannot be extrapolated to the efficacy of fluoxetine when used as the only form of treatment in patients for whom intensive nutritional counselling or other structured psychological programs are not available. The addition of antidepressant treatment to the intensive group psychotherapy component did not significantly improve outcome over intensive group psychotherapy combined with placebo treatment in terms of eating behavior, but did result in more improvement in the symptoms of depression and anxiety. These results can possibly be explained by the existence of a "ceiling effect"."
275,CD001439,"Prophylactic treatment with cephaloridine of patients undergoing surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis resulted in a perceptible reduction in the rate of postoperative wound infection. Systemic prophylactic antibiotics can successfully reduce septic complications after appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis, and a single drug (cefamandole) directed at the facultative pathogens is as effective as double drug therapy, which includes specific anaerobic coverage. No further improvement could be demonstrated if cefuroxime against aerobic organisms was added. No untoward effects were observed. We conclude that there is no place for a single preoperative dosage of cefamandole in the management of appendicitis. They suggest that such antibiotic use be reserved for those suspected of having more serious disease. The postoperative wound infection rate is insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of metronidazole for prophylaxis in nonperforated acute appendicitis, although there appears to be a tendency of to assume its efficacy in this regard. The conclusion of this study is that a combination of an antibiotic aimed at aerobes (cefazolin or tobramycin) with another aiming at anaerobes (metronidazole) is the best prophylactic regime against post-appendicectomy sepsis. No significant difference was found in the incidence of complications between the treated and a control group, raising doubts as to whether this substance is of value when used intraperitoneally in peritonitis. The policy of antibiotic prophylaxis in emergency surgery seems to be of particular benefit in elderly patients. This work supports the value of metronidazole but suggests that a single-dose regimen is adequate for prophylaxis. Five patients with intra-abdominal infections caused by non-clostridial anaerobes were successfully treated with metronidazole. This study supports the already accepted value of metronidazole but suggests that a single intra-rectal dose regimen is adequate for prophylaxis. Tinidazole appears to be well suited to the prophylaxis of post-appendicectomy infections. Systemic antibiotic therapy can successfully reduce the complications following appendicectomy but it is necessary to use a compound with activity against anaerobic organisms. It is suggested that intra-rectal metronidazole, when used exclusively, is not sufficient for effective prophylaxis for appendicitis in childhood. No toxic effects of the antibiotics were detected, no anaesthetic complication occurred, and resistant strains of bacteria normally sensitive to the antibiotics were not isolated from wounds. It is concluded that a single peroperative parenteral dose of antibiotics does not constitute an entirely satisfactory means of wound infection prophylaxis in digestive surgery. It is suggested that an antibiotic which is effective against both aerobic and anaerobic organisms might have an advantage over metronidazole in appendicitis. It is recommended that all patients undergoing surgery for NPA be given 1 d of antibiotic prophylaxis. On the basis of these results the authors recommend that all patients subjected to an appendicectomy be given an intravenous tinidazole prophylaxis. Consequently, routine preoperative prophylaxis is recommended before appendectomy. We conclude that anaerobic organisms are more important than faecal aerobic organisms in the pathogenesis of wound infection after appendicectomy. The study showed that a combination of metronidazole and cotrimoxazole is a regime highly effective for prophylaxis against wound infection following appendicectomy. Predisposing factors for wound infection are leucocytosis greater than 12 000, anamnesis greater than 24 hours, operation time greater than 45 minutes. This study suggests that a single intra-operative dose of metronidazole dose not reduce the incidence of postoperative wound infection following appendicectomy for acute mural appendicitis. If the clinical and economic benefits of metronidazole shown by this study are confirmed, the drug should be considered for routine use in emergency appendicectomy. Septic morbidity after appendectomy for nonperforating appendicitis is significantly reduced by systemic antibiotics, and brief administration of a single broad-spectrum agent (cefoxitin) is effective prophylaxis. Our results give no clear indication of the benefit of metronidazole prophylaxis and we propose, therefore, to concentrate on the technical aspects of appendicectomy in infection prophylaxis. The use of metronidazole in prevention of wound infection is recommended. Although the need for antibiotic prophylaxis is well documented in adults, the rarity of infectious complications makes it highly questionable in the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis in children. In those receiving both drugs the infection rate was 3%, a highly significant difference from that in the other three groups."
276,CD008112,"Additionally, back school was as effective as three manual treatments. Traditional bone-setting seemed more effective than exercise or physiotherapy on back pain and disability, even 1 year after therapy. Relative to "best care" in general practice, manipulation followed by exercise achieved a moderate benefit at three months and a small benefit at 12 months; spinal manipulation achieved a small to moderate benefit at three months and a small benefit at 12 months; and exercise achieved a small benefit at three months but not 12 months. It remains unclear whether the benefits of osteopathic manipulative treatment can be attributed to the manipulative techniques themselves or whether they are related to other aspects of osteopathic manipulative treatment, such as range of motion activities or time spent interacting with patients, which may represent placebo effects. The age of onset of symptoms was significantly later in the responders. The subgroup analysis provides a possible explanation for contrasting results among randomized clinical trials of chronic low back pain treatments and these results also provide guidance for future work in the treatment of chronic low back pain. None of the changes in physical outcome measures (range of motion, fatigue, strength or pain) were significantly different between any of the groups. This trial suggests that combined manual therapy, like naprapathy, might be an alternative to consider for back and neck pain patients. From an evidence-based care perspective, patient preference and clinical experience should drive how clinicians and patients make the SM procedure decision for this patient population. Motor control exercise and spinal manipulative therapy produce slightly better short-term function and perceptions of effect than general exercise, but not better medium or long-term effects, in patients with chronic non-specific back pain. In patients with chronic spinal pain syndromes, spinal manipulation, if not contraindicated, may be the only treatment modality of the assessed regimens that provides broad and significant long-term benefit. The magnitude of nonspecific therapeutic (placebo) effects, cost-effectiveness and relative risks of side effects associated with these types of therapy need to be addressed in future studies. Conclusions: This study suggests that chiropractic management administered in an NHS setting may be effective for reducing levels of disability and perceived pain during the period of treatment for a subpopulation of patients with CLBP. Furthermore, manipulative therapy is slightly better than physiotherapy after 12 months. To our knowledge and up until now, this result has not been shown in patients with chronic low back disorder. The orthopaedic manual therapy and McKenzie methods seemed to be only marginally more effective than was one session of assessment and advice-only. This manual therapy must be preceeded by a specific clinical exam performed by a trained physician. In the long term, however, stabilizing training seemed to be more effective than manual treatment in terms of improvement of individuals and the reduced need for recurrent treatment periods. Physical therapy may be marginally more effective than medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients, but the possible benefit is small."

278,CD002068,"Treatment with 90 mg of pamidronate as a 2-hour intravenous infusion every 4 weeks in addition to hormonal therapy significantly reduces skeletal morbidity from osteolytic metastases. Further studies will be needed to define the role of bisphosphonates such as clodronate in this situation, in comparison with established treatments such as radiotherapy and analgesics. This dose is well tolerated and may promote bone repair, as judged by increases in bone alkaline phosphatase levels. We conclude from these results that CI2MDP could be of use in preventing the bone loss that occurs in multiple myeloma. The optimal dose and duration of effect require further evaluation, particularly in patients with stable disease and persistent bone pain. With the dose scheme used in this study sodium etidronate was ineffective for palliation of bone pain from prostatic cancer. Our preliminary findings suggest that Cl2MDP is safe, and has analgesic properties that may prove to be useful in the management of metastatic bone pain. In conclusion, low dose (800 mg/d) oral clodronate seems to be as effective as standard dose (1600 mg/d) in palliation of bone pain secondary to BM. The new bone resorption markers of collagen breakdown were able to predict clinical response to pamidronate. The overall negative result of the study is attributed to the very low absorption of orally administered bisphosphonates in general. The results do not support the superiority of combined intravenous and oral treatment with clodronate compared with oral administration only. No significant differences were seen in median survival or survival rates between the groups. In conclusion, our results seem to confirm the utility of higher doses of pamidronate in patients with painful bone metastases, because of the faster symptom relief achieved. The drug delays osteolytic bone lesions, reduces the degree of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria, and decreases pain. We conclude that intravenous pamidronate is well tolerated, significantly prolongs time to progressive bone disease, and significantly improves bone pain in patients with osteolytic metastases from breast cancer. We conclude that EHDP therapy used in this dosage schedule does not have a clinically significant impact in multiple myeloma. Though we found no clinical, biological and radiological difference with placebo, etidronate inhibited the increased bone resorption in multiple myeloma. We conclude that oral dichloromethylene diphosphonate can significantly inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone destruction in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer. Pamidronate 90 mg every 3 weeks results in higher bone remineralization, but this difference did not translate into a further increase of palliative effects. Intravenous pamidronate is a well tolerated treatment that produced significant relief of bone pain in the majority of patients with metastatic breast cancer at the three highest doses tested. Tolerance was excellent: only a few patients complained of pain at the intramuscular drug injection site. With these limits, oral clodronate demonstrated some efficacy in symptom control and in reducing the need for analgesics. Monthly infusions of pamidronate provide significant protection against skeletal complications and improve the quality of life of patients with stage III multiple myeloma. Monthly infusions of pamidronate as a supplement to chemotherapy can protect against skeletal complications in women with stage IV breast cancer who have osteolytic bone metastases. Our data indicate that if clodronate is to be used for the alleviation of bone pain in prostate cancer, patients with high baseline should be selected and high intravenous doses should be given at start of the treatment. Further research on dose and mode of treatment is mandatory. The poor tolerability of oral pamidronate coupled with the modest clinical effects reported here suggest that oral pamidronate will not replace the current strategy of regular intravenous infusions of pamidronate for the treatment of osteolytic bone disease."
279,CD004115,"It is concluded that the applied suspension of 5-aminosalicylic acid is at least as efficient as prednisolone for topical treatment of patients with slightly to moderately active proctosigmoiditis. No difference could be observed in terms of efficacy; however, it was the patients' opinion that treatment with suppositories was easier than that with enemas (p less than 0.01). This study indicates that SCFA enemas are equally efficacious to CS or 5-ASA enemas for the treatment of proctosigmoiditis at a significant cost savings. 5-Aminosalicylic acid enemas are well tolerated and are of benefit in the treatment of ulcerative colitis confined to the distal colon. Since no difference was registered between the two types of treatment (p = 0.141, X2 test), 4-ASA could be a possible form of treatment for active ulcerative colitis. Patients treated with 5-ASA reported improvement earlier than those treated with SAS. The foam enema offers a safe, efficacious and acceptable treatment for distal ulcerative colitis. Both treatment regimens are effective; mesalazine suppositories seem to be the preferred alternative. Mesalamine foam represents a therapeutic alternative to mesalamine liquid enema in patients with mild-to-moderate active proctitis and proctosigmoiditis. Moreover, a significantly greater number of refractory patients improve when switched to 5-ASA enemas than when continued on standard therapy. Our experience confirms that short term topical treatment with a low dosage 5-aminosalicylic acid is at least as effective as 100-mg hydrocortisone enemas in treating mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis and is generally well tolerated. BDP administered as a rectal enema over a 6-week treatment period was efficacious and safe in patients with active UC, without interference with pituitary adrenal axis. Budesonide enema 2 mg/100 mL appears to be as efficient and well-tolerated as 5-ASA enema in the treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis and proctitis. This study suggests that 1 g 5-ASA (in a 100 ml enema) is a sufficient dosage for patients with a mild to moderate attack of ulcerative colitis. The logical therapeutic role of sulphasalazine enemas in ulcerative colitis would appear to be in patients who experience side effects such as nausea, abdominal discomfort, or headaches when taking the drug by mouth. Our study showed that topical treatment with 5-ASA is as efficacious as PP in improving distal ulcerative colitis. The combination of oral and rectal mesalamine therapy was well tolerated and produced earlier and more complete relief of rectal bleeding than oral or rectal therapy alone. Low-volume 5-aminosalicylic acid foam is as effective and safe as a high-volume 5-aminosalicylic acid foam in the treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis, but offers compliance advantages compared to the high-volume preparation. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Mesalazine foam enema was well-tolerated and was more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with distal ulcerative colitis. The extended length of remission suggests that alicaforsen enema treatment may have a disease modifying effect. Beclomethasone diproprionate and mesalazine enema and foam show a comparable tolerability and efficacy in mild active distal ulcerative colitis. The new mesalazine gel enema is efficacious and significantly better tolerated than the mesalazine foam enema. Results of this study indicate that treatment with mesalazine suppositories produces earlier and significantly better results than oral mesalazine in the treatment of active ulcerative proctitis. Pentasa 1 g suppository once daily induces a quicker clinical and sigmoidoscopic remission, and was better tolerated, than the Claversal 500 mg suppository b.d., and it may represent an advance for the topical treatment of distal proctosigmoiditis. Preliminary studies suggest that similar rates for induction of remission can be expected from 5-ASA enemas and MMx for patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis. The new foam preparation is as well tolerated and accepted as enemas and can be used as a therapeutic alternative to conventional mesalazine enema formulations. Both treatments were well tolerated. 5-ASA suppositories are safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment for active distal proctitis. However, combination therapy with BDP/5-ASA seems superior to single-agent therapy and causes no adverse reactions. Mesalazine suppositories are safe, well tolerated, and very effective in patients with active distal proctosigmoiditis: 500 mg twice daily appears a suitable dose regimen. This treatment should therefore be offered as a first choice for patients with distal rectosigmoiditis."

Interstitial chemotherapy delivered with polymers directly to brain tumours at the time of surgery seems to be a safe and effective treatment for recurrent malignant gliomas. Carmustine applied locally in a biodegradable polymer at the time of primary operation, seems to have a favorable effect on the life span of patients with high-grade gliomas. Malignant glioma patients treated with BCNU wafers at the time of initial surgery in combination with radiation therapy demonstrated a survival advantage at 2 and 3 years follow-up compared with placebo."

282,CD005137,"When combined with prescribing 1 hour of near visual activities, 2 hours of daily patching produces an improvement in visual acuity that is of similar magnitude to the improvement produced by 6 hours of daily patching in treating moderate amblyopia in children aged 3 to 7 years. Six hours of prescribed daily patching produces an improvement in visual acuity that is of similar magnitude to the improvement produced by prescribed full-time patching in treating severe amblyopia in children 3 to less than 7 years of age. Delay in treatment until the age of 5 did not seem to influence effectiveness. We conclude that these vision changes can be attributed to the short-term occlusion experienced by all subjects during treatment and that grating stimulation did not contribute to this improvement. We do not yet know whether visual acuity improvement will be sustained once treatment is discontinued; therefore, conclusions regarding the long-term benefit of treatment and the development of treatment recommendations for amblyopia in children 7 years and older await the results of a follow-up study we are conducting on the patients who responded to treatment. Perceptual learning might provide an alternative treatment in patients with anisometropic amblyopia. Clinical Trials NCT00274664. After a period of treatment with spectacles, 2 hours of daily patching combined with 1 hour of near visual activities modestly improves moderate to severe amblyopia in children 3 to 7 years old. Children with severe amblyopia may respond to 2 hours of daily patching. However, the 1-year visual acuity outcome was not statistically significantly different between the 2 treatments."

284,CD005365,"This study does not suggest that routine perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory in neurosurgery. This study, combined with other recently published analyses, suggests that routine perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis can significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative neurosurgical infections. We did not find that the perioperative use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim reduced the incidence of shunt infection or malfunction. Piperacillin thus appeared to reduce the incidence of neurosurgical wound infection in this study. There were no differences in the infection rates between these groups (one of 25 in Group 3 as against one of 27 in Group 4). Nevertheless, the frequency of methicillin-resistant staphylococci, which account for 20% of nosocomial staphylococcal infections, constitutes a limiting factor for such prevention. Therefore, we favor single dose antibiotic prophylaxis in shunting procedures. The infection rates observed were 6% in the group of patients who received antibiotic treatment prophylactically and 14% in the untreated control group. A large multicentre trial is needed to determine the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing the incidence of postoperative VP shunt infections. Delayed shunt malfunction may be prevented by a short course of perioperative antibiotics. The AIS system represents another important tool to enable the neurosurgeon to prevent shunt infections. The use of EVD catheters impregnated with minocycline and rifampin can significantly reduce the risk of catheter-related infections. Because of the adverse reactions to vancomycin, the study was discontinued. Methodological problems encountered in this and other studies of prevention of CSF shunt infection will be discussed."

287,CD007191,"Prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex can safely be withdrawn or withheld in adults with HIV infection who experience increases in CD4(+) cell count while receiving antiretroviral therapy. Azithromycin prophylaxis can safely be withheld in HIV-infected patients whose CD4+ cell counts have increased to more than 100 cells per cubic millimeter in response to antiretroviral therapy. Azithromycin given once weekly is safe and effective in preventing disseminated MAC infection, death due to MAC infection, and respiratory tract infections in patients with AIDS and CD4 cell counts of < 100/mm3. In patients with advanced AIDS, the prophylactic administration of clarithromycin is well tolerated, prevents M. avium complex infection, and reduces mortality. Clarithromycin and combination therapy were more effective than rifabutin for prevention of MAC disease, but combination therapy was associated with more adverse effects (31%; P<.001). Rifabutin, given prophylactically, reduces the frequency of disseminated M. avium complex infection in patients with AIDS and CD4 counts < or = 200 per cubic millimeter. Reduction in CD4 lymphocyte count to < 50/mm3 is a significant predictor of the development of disseminated MAC infection."
288,CD003893,"Thus, in patients with intermittent claudication antihypertensives should be used with care. No significant differences were found between the effects of propranolol, practolol, or methyldopa at the doses used. These results indicate that isradipine is superior to methyldopa and, whether as monotherapy or in combination with captopril, highly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension. Our observations seem to support the usefulness in hypertensive patients with concomitant lesions in the peripheral arterial tree of antihypertensive agents such as methyldopa and indapamide which increase blood flow and reduce peripheral resistance while lowering high blood pressure. Trimazosin, 900 mg daily, and methyldopa, 2,250 mg daily, were equally effective in lowering supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure and did not affect supine or standing heart rate. Adverse effects were infrequent. Simple crossover studies are inadequate for detecting moderate drug effects on intellectual performance."
289,CD001024,"Tamoxifen has no efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced HCC and response to treatment was not affected by the expression of hormone receptors. the update of the present study confirms that tamoxifen is not effective in prolonging survivals, both in advanced patients and in those potentially curable and that the CLIP score is able to predict prognosis. In this series, tamoxifen improved survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Tamoxifen has no efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Tamoxifen may have a role in maintenance of doxorubicin-induced remissions. These findings suggest that the effect of the antiestrogen tamoxifen is both statistically and clinically significant in increasing survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No appreciable advantage to QoL with TMX was observed. We conclude that tamoxifen does not extend the survival of patients with cirrhosis and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma."
290,CD008241,"There was a higher prevalence of delayed union and breakage of screws after nailing without reaming. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to fracture union. The results of our study support those of other studies that indicate the choice between the 2 methods of unreamed nailing is mainly controversial, depending on the priorities of the patient and surgeon. Compared with a transpatellar tendon approach, a paratendinous approach for nail insertion does not reduce the prevalence of chronic anterior knee pain or functional impairment by a clinically relevant amount after intramedullary nailing of a tibial shaft fracture. These data support acute (within three days of injury) reamed intramedullary nailing of closed, displaced tibial shaft fractures without the use of a fracture table. The time to fracture healing was significantly longer with unreamed nails. Ender nail still has its superior usefulness in some aspects of treatment of less comminuted unstable tibial shaft fractures, but for the more comminuted unstable tibial shaft fractures, the interlocking nail is undoubtedly better used."
291,CD006378,"These findings support the feasibility of nimesulide therapy in AD; assessment of efficacy will require a larger, long-term treatment study. The results of this study indicate that rofecoxib or low-dose naproxen does not slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Although aspirin is commonly used in dementia, in patients with typical AD 2 years of treatment with low-dose aspirin has no worthwhile benefit and increases the risk of serious bleeds. The failure of selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibition to slow the progression of AD may indicate either that the disease process is too advanced to modify in patients with established dementia or that cyclo-oxygenase-2 does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. D/M is safe in AD patients, but its tolerability is not optimal. Our results suggest the need to examine whether differences in the response to NSAIDs exist, based on ApoE epsilon4 carrier status.

292,CD002214,"Further studies of nurse-led team care are required, and the stress and anxiety for staff consequent on developing the nurse's role in this way should be considered. However, since the unit may substitute for both secondary and primary care, longer-term follow-up is needed to determine whether patients are better prepared for discharge under this model of care, resulting in reduced primary-care costs. The NLIU does offer some potential to substitute for acute care but also appears to substitute for a period of primary care. The nurse-led unit seemed to be a safe alternative to conventional management, but a full accounting of such units' place in the local continuum of care and the costs associated with acute hospitals managing post-acute patients is needed if nurse-led units are to become an effective part of the government's recent commitment to intermediate care. Results from this 4-year clinical trial demonstrate that nurse case managers in a SCU setting can produce patient outcomes equal to or better than those in the traditional ICU care environment for long-term critically ill patients."
293,CD004136,"The effects of candesartan, with reduction in morphological parameters and lowering of blood pressure, might influence future treatment of glomerulopathy in type 1 diabetes patients. There was no statistically significant difference between lisinopril 40 mg once daily and lisinopril 20 mg in combination with candesartan 16 mg once daily in reducing systolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with diabetes. 2009 Massachusetts Medical Society Our results show that lisinopril does not increase the risk of hypoglycaemic events in IDDM. In adults with vascular disease but without macroalbuminuria, the effects of telmisartan on major renal outcomes were similar to those of placebo. Candesartan, 32 mg/d, for 4.7 years did not prevent microalbuminuria in mainly normotensive patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Neither drug showed any negative side effects on fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and both maintain constant AERs. Although combination therapy reduces proteinuria to a greater extent than monotherapy, overall it worsens major renal outcomes. The clinical consequences of the insignificant differences in AER remain unclear. In conclusion, this study confirms the efficacy and safety of losartan as an antihypertensive drug in diabetic patients. The 3-fold difference in the incidence of side effects, although not statistically significant for the available sample size, may be clinically relevant. In the macroalbuminuric patients, the rate of deterioration in renal function was also attenuated by treatment with enalapril. Over a five-year follow-up period, intensive (approximately 128/75 mm Hg) BP control in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients: (1) slowed the progression to incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy; (2) decreased the progression of diabetic retinopathy; and (3) diminished the incidence of stroke. However, the degree of BP control, with both cilazapril and amlodipine, can successfully delay the slope of GFR decline in hypertensive NIDDM patients with or without incipient nephropathy. Further research is needed to determine whether this treatment forestalls the development of overt nephropathy. Intensive BP control with valsartan to <120/80 mm Hg in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes and normo- or microalbuminuria significantly decreased the progression of UAE and in some cases caused regression of UAE. We could not identify a BP threshold below which renal benefit is lost. These data suggest a protective effect of lisinopril against the development of microalbuminuria. The nephroprotective effects of ACE inhibitor treatment was not associated with the ACE genotype (II, ID, DD). Fosinopril and amlodipine had similar effects on biochemical measures, but the patients randomized to fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of major vascular events, compared with the patients randomized to amlodipine. )."

295,CD001055,"If these findings are replicated, prenatal clinics could offer the option for intensive smoking cessation treatment by training mental health counselors to deliver one extended smoking cessation counseling session. Those receiving high feedback were more likely to report that they had acted on health advice given at the first antenatal visit to reduce their smoking and drinking. (P less than or equal to .05 for all findings.) I. Brief advice appears to be ineffective. In addition, this technique is inexpensive, readily accepted by staff, and efficient. A low cost health promotion program of telephone support during pregnancy can significantly improve a woman's psychosocial status during pregnancy. Good quality motivational interviewing did not significantly increase smoking cessation among pregnant women. An intervention of psychosocial support and health education during pregnancy failed to show any benefit on perinatal outcome, health-related behavior, or utilization of health facilities. Physician training on how to gain a pregnant smoker's commitment to change her smoking behavior, an office prompt system, and individualized smoking behavior change counseling show promise in reducing smoking during pregnancy and postpartum, but practical methods to assist pregnant smokers between regular prenatal visits, as they attempt to quit, need to be developed. There were no significant differences among the three groups for either the number who quit smoking or who reduced the number of cigarettes smoked. Health professionals should also support better-targeted public health campaigns and tobacco-control initiatives generally, because, undoubtedly, the social environment is a major determinant of initiation and continuation of smoking. The findings reinforce the importance of a whole population approach to tobacco control. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Achieving quit rates in WIC similar to those in studies conducted at prenatal care settings, suggests that smoking cessation programs for low-income pregnant WIC clients are feasible. Relapse prevention interventions may need to be increased in duration and potency to prevent post-partum relapse. These results indicate that the use of peer support may be an effective adjunct in smoking cessation programs for pregnant adolescents. This study suggests that the use of videotapes modeling smoking behavior change may increase the effectiveness of the assistance in quitting smoking that is generally available in obstetric and family practices or public maternity clinics. This programme is inexpensive, requires little extra effort, and does not need specially trained personnel. Education and support by midwives, as part of primary midwifery, can facilitate smoking cessation and reduction during pregnancy. Nicotine patches had no influence on smoking cessation during pregnancy, although they might increase birth weight in comparison with placebo. It was concluded that the intervention had either a small or no influence on cigarette smoking. '. Interventions extended into postpartum care did not affect relapse and smoking rates postdelivery. Special attention should be paid to the needs of heavier smokers. the intervention therefore helped to cut the number of cigarettes smoked. Given the negative outcomes associated with self-help materials and clinic-based counseling reported in this and other trials, alternative intervention strategies need to be developed and tested for this significant group of prepregnancy smokers. Other possible interpretations of the results, that maternal smoking is merely an index of some other factor that retards growth or that those counselled did not reduce their smoking sufficiently to influence outcome, cannot be excluded. Although adding individual smoking cessation counseling did not increase quitting rates during pregnancy, it should be considered for women in public maternity clinics because of its potential long-term effectiveness. The midwife-assisted smoking cessation intervention seems to be an effective tool to help pregnant smokers make a decision to quit smoking. Given also that the intervention was resource intensive, it is of doubtful benefit. Ultrasound screening does not reduce the frequency of smoking during pregnancy. The factors that contribute to the lack of a significant increase in smoking cessation in the intervention group and the possible explanation for the changes in birth-weight are discussed. While there was no effect of counselling on either serum thiocyanate or end expiratory carbon monoxide, the counselled group gained slightly more weight than controls during the study (0.47 vs. 0.44 kg per week among controls; NS), and their infants had modestly higher birthweight (44 g; NS). The findings suggest that some fetal growth retardation can be overcome by the provision of antismoking assistance to pregnant women. Improvements in the intervention and implementation issues are discussed. Achieving changes in smoking behavior in pregnant women with low-intensity interventions is difficult. An important precondition is that midwives need a proper training. More data are needed to determine safety parameters and to confirm the efficacy of NRT use during pregnancy. Current smoking cessation rates in pregnancy are very low. This intervention, implemented by clinic personnel as part of routine medical visits, was effective under these natural conditions across different types of clinic service. Point-of-care testing and feedback coupled with counselling can significantly reduce smoking during pregnancy and increase birthweight. A multimodal intervention regimen with initial individual counseling supplemented by an invitation to join a smoking cessation program with nicotine replacement therapy as a voluntary option markedly increased cessation rates during pregnancy. The use of overseas programs needs to be approached with caution. The shift was not maintained at the 36-week visit. These results provide further evidence that VBRT has a substantive contribution to make to efforts to decrease maternal smoking during pregnancy and provide new evidence of positive effects on fetal health. Many had tried to quit smoking at least once prior to pregnancy. Results of this trial indicate that health education methods tailored to the pregnant smoker are more effective in changing smoking behavior than the standard clinic information and advice to quit and/or the use of smoking cessation methods not tailored to the needs of the pregnant smoker. We conclude that a low-cost prenatal self-help intervention can significantly affect the public health problem of smoking during pregnancy and its associated risks for maternal and child health. Infant birth weight increases with both smoking cessation and smoking reduction, suggesting that peer counseling intervention programs may improve newborn health despite their failure to affect smoking cessation. The differences in birthweight and length between the intervention and control groups were concentrated almost entirely among the first born infants who were 68 g heavier and 0.75 cm longer in the intervention group than the first born infants in the control group. Health education methods are efficacious and cost beneficial for pregnant smokers in public health maternity clinics. The magnitude of these treatment effects exceed levels typically observed with pregnant and recently postpartum smokers, and the maintenance of effects through 24 weeks postpartum extends the duration beyond those reported previously. Validated smoking cessation rates among pregnant women are substantially lower than the self reported rates on which current smoking policy is based. We conclude that smoking in pregnancy, being one of the few amenable to risk factors affecting the perinatal death statistics, demands an active smoking cessation program during pregnancy led by specially trained health professionals. We recorded a 10% quit rate in both intervention group and control group, and 42% and 31% reduced their smoking in the intervention group and control group, respectively. The resources invested are probably within the limits of the common pregnancy health care. The application of principles of organizational development and quality improvement at the management and clinical practice levels and the delivery of evidence-based health education methods by trained prenatal care providers significantly increased smoking cessation rates among pregnant Medicaid recipients."
296,CD001984,"This conclusion is robust through a range of plausible values used in a sensitivity analysis. Recommendations for future trials include a longer education program, more vigorous physical training, and longterm followup. In EDI, fear reduction might have enhanced pain coping and pain control, while poor compliance, the difficulty of homework assignments, and lack of individual support may have limited the effectiveness of ECO. Taken as a whole, the results show that applied relaxation can produce significant decreases in pain, and that the addition of an operant programme does not improve pain reductions, but does tend to improve results with activity and especially medicine intake variables. The immigrants, as a group, did not benefit from the programme compared to the controls in primary care. In conclusion, this study has shown the ASES-S to be a valid measure of treatment effects also for patients with FS. At follow up, there were no obvious group differences in symptom severity, which for AE seemed to be due to a considerable compliance problem. The findings illustrate the value of psychoeducational interventions in decreasing the psychological and behavioral effect of FM, and the value of reducing dysfunctional coping and helplessness in future intervention research."

298,CD000436,"CONCLUSION A low and high dietary salt intake for two weeks has no effect on peak expiratory flow in patients with mild asthma. A low-salt diet appears to have a favorable effect in patients with asthma and to reduce the need for anti-asthma drugs. These findings are compatible with the differences in regional mortality data for England and Wales, which show a relation between asthma mortality and regional per person purchases of table salt for men but not for women. These data suggest that both sodium and chloride contribute to the worsening of EIA symptoms seen after consuming a normal or high NaCl diet. Our findings indicate that dietary salt loading enhances airway inflammation following exercise in asthmatic subjects, and that small salt-dependent changes in vascular volume and microvascular pressure might have substantial effects on airway function following exercise in the face of mediator-induced increased vascular permeability. These data suggest that individuals with EIA might benefit from lower salt diets. Our results suggest that large increases in dietary sodium result in physiological deterioration and increased morbidity in male asthmatic patients."
299,CD004829,"Despite higher pain scores, in comparison with the conventional analgesia, patient-controlled isodesox offers a safer method of pain relief with comparable satisfaction rates. The procedure is well tolerated by the patients, with a shorter hospitalization time and lower costs. Nor was the effectiveness of the in vitro fertilization technique affected by any of the anesthetic techniques studied. We conclude that one of the benefits of natural-cycle IVF using transvaginal single-follicle aspiration is that it can be performed without analgesia. Although PCS provides less analgesia then PAS during TUGOR, it is safe, satisfactory and accepted by patients. For the patients with moderate pain thresholds, acupuncture compound anesthesia has good analgesic effect. In transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval, acupuncture compound anesthesia has the advances of safety, high effectiveness, rapid recovery after oocyte retrieval, and few side effects. An advantage of EA is less post-operative tiredness and confusion compared with CA. However, target controlled infusion of remifentanil at 1.5 or 2 ng/mL proved superior at providing early recovery compared to 2.5 ng/mL. The use of PCB along is not recommended for all patients but it may be considered with selected patients after they have been given extensive counseling. Though intraoperative PCA with fentanyl is an effective alternative to physician-administered techniques, many women still feel the need for more analgesia during the procedure. We conclude that the sedative combination of midazolam and ketamine for oocyte retrieval may serve as an alternative for general anaesthesia. In conclusion, EA has been shown to be as good an anaesthetic method as alfentanil during oocyte aspiration, and we suggest that EA may be a good alternative to conventional anaesthesia during oocyte aspiration. The analgesic effects produced by EA are as good as those produced by conventional analgesics, and the use of opiate analgesics with EA is lower than when conventional analgesics alone are used. Both anesthesia regimens provided satisfactory analgesia without affecting FEV1 and FVC, but significantly higher plasma remifentanil concentrations were calculated when only RI was used as an anesthetic technique. After 30 min the p-deletion and critical flicker fusion scores were still impaired in the midazolam, but not in the propofol, group. Even with the mandatory lockout interval, intraoperative patient-controlled administration of alfentanil was comparable to physician-controlled administration with respect to patient comfort and satisfaction during vaginal ovum pickup procedures. Auricular EA significantly reduces pain intensity and analgesic consumption of the opioid remifentanil during oocyte aspiration in IVF treatment."
300,CD006866,"Oral acyclovir appears to modify the disease process in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, to reduce the severity and incidence of postherpetic pain and especially to protect against long-term ocular complications. Oral famciclovir, 500 mg or 750 mg three times daily for 7 days, is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for herpes zoster that decreases the duration of the disease's most debilitating complication, postherpetic neuralgia. In summary, oral acyclovir at a dosage of 800 mg five times per day for 10 days for treatment of acute herpes zoster is superior to 400 mg five times per day and favorably alters the course of the disease. In relatively healthy persons older than 50 years of age who have localized herpes zoster, combined acyclovir and prednisone therapy can improve quality of life. No clinically important adverse effects of acyclovir were reported. Biochemical and haematological tests showed no adverse effects of treatment."

302,CD006107,"Ultrasound guidance in frozen-thawed embryo transfer significantly increases pregnancy and implantation rates. In conclusion, ultrasound assistance in embryo transfer significantly improved pregnancy and implantation rates in IVF. It is recommended that embryo transfer should be performed under US guidance. As long as previous mock transfers are routinely performed during a cycle preceding assisted reproduction and the clinician considers transfer to be easy, ultrasound does not benefit the process of embryo transfer. Ultrasound-guided embryo transfer can significantly increase the rate of implantation and clinical pregnancy, and should be recommended as a routine procedure in the process of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET). Therefore, the Frydman catheter is used as the first choice, and for difficult transfers the TDT catheter under ultrasound guidance can be recommended. The extent of improvement in the pregnancy rate may depend on the specific techniques and methods of embryo transfer used in individual centres. We suggest that the current Cochrane review should be updated with data from our trial and recommend that consideration is given to accounting for heterogeneity between the included trials. Ultrasound-guided ET significantly increases ongoing pregnancy/live-birth and clinical pregnancy rates compared with the clinical touch method. Although the clinical pregnancy rate was not statistically different (18.5% in the ultrasound-guided group vs. 17.4% in the clinical touch group), the use of abdominal ultrasound during the embryo transfer procedure provided a greater degree of confidence and satisfaction to both patients and physicians."
303,CD009274,"The once-daily BDP dosing (400 micro g/day) therefore has a similar efficacy and safety profile as the same daily dose given in a twice-daily regimen. This placebo-controlled study does not show that treatment with FPANS up to 1 year after FESS had a positive effect compared with placebo. After 11 days of treatment, significantly better results were obtained in cases of bacterial sinusitis (94% deobstruction with tixocortol pivalate-neomycin versus 74% with neomycin) than in cases of allergic sinusitis (69% deobstruction with tixocortol pivalate-neomycin versus 36% with neomycin). These findings suggest that evacuation of the pathological effusions in sinuses may exert a beneficial effect by reducing the levels of IL-1beta and IL-8, and we speculate that removal of pathological effusions from the sinuses may provide treatment through different mechanisms than those that occur in treatment with betamethasone. Topical budesonide delivered through a maxillary antrum sinusotomy tube can control chronic rhinosinusitis that persists after surgery. There is compelling evidence that topical corticosteroids down-regulate cytokine expression, and it is likely that a larger, and longer multi-centre trial may prove their efficacy in CRS. Thus, in treatment of chronic mucopurulent rhinosinusitis, reduction of the inflammatory response and decongestion make topical antibiotic unnecessary, probably by allowing host clearance mechanisms to recover. These results suggest that treatment with MFNS following sinus surgery may improve wound healing, particularly in subjects with nasal polyps. BANS is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. Topical steroid therapy did not cause any adverse effects."

An early interdisciplinary intervention approach can be effective in reducing protein-energy malnutrition and related hospital-acquired infections and appears to be economically feasible."
306,CD001939,"We conclude that long-term branched-chain amino acid supplementation is well tolerated and effective in the treatment of impaired automobile driving capacity associated with latent portosystemic encephalopathy. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in the presence of hepatic decompensation with an amino acid solution formulated for its treatment seems to produce faster, more complete recovery with improved capacity for nutritional support. The supplementation of oral branched-chain amino acids to the diet is superior to casein as a treatment for providing adequate nitrogen supply and improving the mental state of cirrhotic patients with chronic encephalopathy. These data argue strongly in favour of a therapeutic effect of branched chain amino acids in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver failure. Taking into account the crossover design, significant improvements attributable to branched chain amino acid treatment could be demonstrated in psychomotor functions (line tracing, tapping, steadiness, auditory reaction time), attention (digit table), and practical intelligence (digit symbol, number connection test). Thus, the branched chain enriched amino acid supplement did not change the prognosis for wake-up, but had other effects on the cerebral state and on nitrogen homeostasis. The authors conclude that modified AA solutions are ineffective in the treatment of acute hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients."
307,CD006883,"Implications: The administration of prophylactic tranexamic acid in patients with scoliosis who are undergoing posterior spinal fusion surgery has the potential to reduce perioperative blood transfusion requirements. Intraoperative administration of tranexamic acid significantly reduces blood loss during spinal surgery in children with scoliosis. The results have allowed us to reduce our recommendation for perioperative autologous blood donation, thereby further decreasing costs. Although the difference was not significant statistically, the benefit of aprotinin in reducing blood loss in spinal surgery for idiopathic scoliosis was consistent. This randomized, blinded study suggests that aprotinin significantly decreased blood loss and transfusion requirements in pediatric and adolescent scoliosis surgical patients at increased risk for intraoperative bleeding."
308,CD003913,"The combination of methyl-CCNU + DTIC was more toxic than BCNU, producing severe or worse thrombocytopenia in 23% of the patients as compared to 6% on BCNU. DBD plus BCNU is an effective adjuvant therapy for malignant glioma. The cure rate was not improved. More effective regimens for the treatment of malignant glioma should be sought. There was no statistically significant difference between the means or medians in any of these situations. This study suggests that the administration of DBD during irradiation might have been the main factor in improving survival times. Tumor histological malignancy and patients age were found to be the only important prognostic factors, irrespective of the treatment modality. This study suggests that it is best to use radiotherapy in the post-surgical treatment of malignant glioma and to continue the search for an effective chemotherapeutic regimen to use in addition to radiotherapy."
309,CD004572,"Thus, even low residual levels of aldose reductase activity may be neurotoxic in diabetes, and potent ARIs such as zenarestat may be required to stop or reverse progression of DPN. Other measures (vibration QST, neuropathy rating scores, monofilament examination) are insensitive to changes over 12 months in a mild-to-moderate affected population of this size. The progression of mild diabetic autonomic and peripheral neuropathy may be halted or even reversed by pharmacologic intervention with the aldose-reductase inhibitor tolrestat. In conclusion, ponalrestat did not improve peripheral nerve function in diabetes mellitus patients with signs of peripheral neuropathy, although it did ameliorate a deterioration in autonomic nerve function in diabetic patients with signs of autonomic neuropathy. Tolrestat may be useful in the primary prevention of diabetic neuropathy. It is concluded that sorbinil treatment results in some improvement in peripheral nerve function in symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy, but that the long-term effect may be of limited value. Further studies are indicated with intervention at an earlier stage in the evolution of neuropathy and for longer periods. The effects of fidarestat-treatment on nerve conduction and the subjective symptoms of diabetic neuropathy provide evidence that this treatment alters the progression of diabetic neuropathy. In conclusion, one-year treatment with Tolrestat significantly improved oesophageal motility and vibration perception in Type-2 diabetic patients with asymptomatic diabetic neuropathy. The improvement after six months of therapy was mild but significant; therefore the authors conclude that the tolrestat is an useful drug in the treatment of the peripheral diabetic neuropathy in addition to attainment of a better glycemia's control. It is concluded that one-year treatment with ponalrestat has no beneficial effects on symptoms or electrophysiological parameters in diabetic neuropathy. Moreover, the deterioration of motor nerve conduction velocity and vibration threshold that had occurred in patients initially treated with placebo, was stopped during open-label treatment with tolrestat. Measurement of erythrocyte sorbitol concentrations demonstrated very significant inhibition of aldose reductase activity with sorbinil treatment, but no concomitant improvement in either peripheral or autonomic nerve function was observed. Levels of PA-I in plasma influence the amounts of t-PA precipitated in euglobulins. Overall, we found no evidence that the early clinical signs and symptoms of diabetic neuropathy were altered by sorbinil. These observations suggest that epalrestat may have therapeutic value at the early stage of diabetic neuropathy and that the pupillary light reflex and minimum latency of F-wave may be useful indicators of diabetic neuropathy. No beneficial effect of Sorbinil was demonstrated on either the clinical manifestation or on the neurophysiological measurements made in these neuropathic diabetic patients over 12 months of treatment. Diabetic patients with neuropathy have LV abnormalities that can be stabilized and partially reversed by ARI treatment. Tolrestat may therefore be helpful in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, where there is little opportunity for therapeutic intervention apart from effort to achieve normoglycaemic control. It is concluded that some sustained improvement in symptomatic diabetic neuropathy may be obtained following aldose-reductase inhibition with tolrestat 200 mg once daily. We conclude that sorbinil, as a metabolic intervention targeted against a specific biochemical consequence of hyperglycemia, can improve the neuropathologic lesions of diabetic neuropathy. Therefore these methods are recommended in future therapy trials. These results indicate that neurophysiological techniques are necessary, in conjunction with clinical measurements, for the assessment of 'early' diabetic neuropathy and that aldose reductase inhibitors are not effective in the treatment of established diabetic neuropathy. Firmer knowledge of clinico-pathological correlates allied to improved non-invasive neurophysiological measurement techniques should facilitate the selection of patients for future therapeutic trials in diabetic neuropathy. The data suggest that aldose reductase inhibition has effects on platelet reactivity and microalbuminuria."

Combined aerobic and resistance exercise soon after the completion of breast cancer therapy produces large and rapid improvements in health-related outcomes. Exercise therapy had large, clinically meaningful, short-term beneficial effects on QoL in women treated for breast cancer; this finding cannot be attributable to attention, given that the exercise-placebo group did not report similar effects relative to usual care. Further research is needed to determine how the program can be enhanced so that improved physical performance also translates into improved physical and psychosocial functioning in daily life.

313,CD006853,"Our findings document the feasibility and efficacy of conditioning exercise for people who have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Individually adapted exercise programs can therefore be recommended for elderly rheumatoid arthritis patients on steroid treatment. Exercise duration up to 35 minutes can be therapeutic, and as little as 15 minutes of exercise 3 times/week is sufficient to improve aerobic capacity in rheumatoid arthritis patients with severe limitations. Intensive dynamic training is more effective in increasing aerobic capacity, joint mobility, and muscle strength than ROM exercises and isometric training in rheumatoid arthritis patients with well controlled disease. Intensive exercise does not increase radiographic damage of the large joints, except possibly in patients with considerable baseline damage of the large joints. It is concluded that 8 wk of bicycle training does not influence the immune system of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The conclusion is that although most patients are in favour of training, the present study does not support that training lessons per se affect the disease activity or the progression of the disease."
314,CD007024,"This study underlines (a) the significance of alcohol use among treatment-seeking cocaine abusers, (b) the promise of the strategy of treating co-morbid disorders among drug-dependent individuals, and (c) the importance of combining psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in the treatment of drug use disorders. More patients taking the disulfiram-naltrexone combination achieved 3 consecutive weeks of abstinence in treatment than placebo-treated patients. This preliminary study suggests the potential efficacy of disulfiram versus placebo for treatment of cocaine dependence in buprenorphine-maintained patients. Since cocaine is a potent catecholamine re-uptake inhibitor, disulfiram may blunt cocaine craving or alter the "high", resulting in a decreased desire to use cocaine. This pilot study suggests that the transient efficacy of pharmacological treatments in maintaining subjects drug free, does not add to the capability of CBT to retain them in treatment."
315,CD007579,"TDS appears safe for continuous antiemetic administration. Parturients who received droperidol reported a more frequent incidence of restlessness (16%) than those who received dexamethasone (P<0.05). A subhypnotic dose of midazolam (1 mg x h(-1)) was as effective as the subhypnotic dose of propofol (1 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in parturients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. We conclude that 0.5 mg of intravenous droperidol decreases nausea in term parturients undergoing non-urgent cesarean section with epidural anesthesia without producing unwanted side-effects. Metoclopramide administered before induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery appears to significantly reduce both pre- and postdelivery emetic symptoms without apparent adverse effects on mother or neonate. Although 10 mg propofol has been described as an effective direct antiemetic, episodes of IONV were neither prevented nor reversed by its use during intradural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. The results suggest that prophylactic use of acupressure bands bilaterally on the P6 acupoint failed to prevent nausea and vomiting during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. The median difference in the cumulative fentanyl dose was 100 (75, 100) microg fentanyl, (P = 0.0002). Other variables were similar between the groups. Acupressure is an effective, non-pharmacologic method to reduce intraoperative nausea during elective cesarean section in the awake patient. The administration of supplemental oxygen from anesthetic induction until the end of the surgery did not reduce the incidence of intra- and postoperative nausea or vomiting in women undergoing cesarean section under subarachnoid block. Prophylactic IV ondansetron 8 mg is safe and effective in reducing the frequency and the severity of nausea and vomiting, but not pruritus, following cesarean delivery with intrathecal sufentanil-morphine. Further investigations are needed to see whether acupressure may be an effective non-pharmacological, non-invasive treatment for a common problem in this sub-group of patients. A bolus dose of midazolam (2 mg) was more effective than metoclopramide (10 mg) for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in parturients patients undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia, however, further studies are needed to prove the safety of midazolam in parturient patients undergoing caesarean section. Prophylactic ondansetron 4 mg IV is more effective in preventing nausea than vomiting. There were no differences in neonatal Apgar scores between groups. Dexamethasone, 5 mg i.v., is suggested as the minimum effective dose in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with epidural morphine for post-Cesarean analgesia. Both prophylactic ondansetron and droperidol were similarly effective, and significantly better than placebo, in reducing the incidence and severity of intraoperative emetic symptoms in cesarean section patients under epidural anesthesia. We conclude that the intra-operative administration of 4 mg ondansetron intravenously during Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia significantly reduces the incidence of vomiting and the severity of nausea. Nalbuphine and ondansetron are more effective than placebo for the prevention of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus after cesarean delivery. Ondansetron was effective in reducing the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving intrathecal morphine for Caesarean section. This combination was more effective than either dexamethasone 8 mg or droperidol 1.25 mg alone in preventing nausea and vomiting after spinal anesthesia using 0.5% bupivacaine and morphine 0.2 mg. We conclude that metoclopramide (15 mg) and droperidol (0.5 mg) were similarly effective. Although the ondansetron reduced the incidence of PONV and the need for further antiemetic medication, this did not affect patient's satisfaction regarding their postoperative care. The results demonstrate that prophylactic use of acupressure bands bilaterally on the P-6 acupoint can significantly reduce incidence of nausea and vomiting after epidural morphine for post-Cesarean section pain relief. It also lessens the severity of nausea and vomiting, and increases maternal satisfaction in the early postoperative period. Its use, however, was associated with a higher incidence of side effects such as dry mouth and blurry vision. droperidol reduced nausea and vomiting but did not prevent itching, and that epidural droperidol failed to prevent all side effects. There was also no difference between the two groups in nausea scores, number of vomiting episodes, or patient satisfaction with postoperative nausea and vomiting management."

317,CD002982,"Body therapy practised in 'autogenic training' and 'functional relaxation' seems to be another important healing factor for the treatment in addition to the discussion sessions and the exchange of information. Larger scale studies on this topic are suggested. These findings provide initial support for the feasibility of self-administered manual-based interventions and some evidence that they can produce health benefits in individuals with asthma and, perhaps, other chronic conditions. This study shows the efficacy of a hypnotic technique in adult asthmatics who are moderately to highly susceptible to hypnosis. Participation in an individualised programme resulted in improvement of asthma morbidity, and asthma-related behaviour and cognitions, in subjects reporting symptoms and impairment despite adequate medical therapy. Implications of these findings for this clinical population are addressed. Lessons learned in this study may facilitate improvement in research designs. Further evaluation of this method is warranted. Contrary to hypothesis, BTI produced better outcomes than CTAM. Listening to music produced greater decreases in peaks of tension than progressive relaxation, and it produced greater compliance with relaxation practice, but it did not produce any specific therapeutic effects on asthma. However, deep breathing during RSA biofeedback is a possible alternate explanation. These results suggest that autogenic therapy could be an effective adjunctive treatment in bronchial asthma."

319,CD001490,"Children treated with intravenous magnesium infusions for moderate to severe asthma had significantly greater improvement in short-term pulmonary function without any significant alteration in blood pressure, suggesting a role for this agent as an adjunct in the treatment of such patients. Routine early administration of IV magnesium in acute asthma does not alter treatment outcome. Intravenous magnesium sulfate may represent a beneficial adjunct therapy in patients with moderate to severe asthma who show little improvement with beta-agonists. Addition of MgSO4 to conventional therapy helps in achieving earlier improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of asthma and PEFR in patients not responding to conventional therapy alone. Intravenous MgSO4 decreased admission rate and improved FEV1 in patients with acute severe asthma but did not cause significant improvement in patients with moderate asthma. Use of IV magnesium sulfate in addition to standard therapy does not provide clinically meaningful improvement of objective measures of expiratory flow in patients with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations."
320,CD006133,"Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. The contraceptive combination of ethinylestradiol and drospirenone used in a continuous regimen was associated with metabolic alterations similar to those found during the traditional cyclic regimen of oral contraceptive use. Body weight, IRI and GPP did not change significantly during the study. The monophasic COC NOMAC/E2 had less influence on haemostasis, lipids and carbohydrate metabolism than the COC LNG/EE. This effect appears to be dose-related and progressive with continued therapy; the significance of these results is discussed. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Both the vaginal ring and the oral contraceptive have no clinically relevant effects on carbohydrate metabolism, adrenal or thyroid function. In conclusion, the safety of both preparations with regard to carbohydrate metabolism was confirmed using the most accurate method available; furthermore, changes in lipid metabolism were such as to have little clinical significance. Overall there were no statistically significant differences among the three formulations in their effects on carbohydrate metabolism as measured by glucose or insulin levels after 6 months of treatment. The vaginal ring may represent an appropriate choice for long-term contraception in women at risk for developing diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. By contrast, EE/CMA does not deteriorate SI and induces a favorable lipid profile. The NET/EE preparation appeared to induce a greater increase in triglycerides, but no significant difference was found between the two pill preparations with respect to HDL-cholesterol changes. Carbohydrate metabolism as reflected by glucose tolerance showed deterioration with all 3 pills, being least with Microgynon 30 and greatest with Marvelon at 12 months. The glucose-induced suppression of plasma glucagon levels seemed less effective for treatment with the desogestrel-containing preparations than with the levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives. The 24-day GTD 60 microg/EE 15 microg formulation and DSG/EE produced similar effects on hemostatic balance, lipid metabolism and glucose tolerance, and exhibited comparable efficacy and tolerability. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The observed changes were small and not suggestive of a clinically relevant deterioration of carbohydrate metabolism. Such minor changes have not been associated with cardiovascular diseases and support the safety of low-dose triphasic preparations. every 84 +/- 5 days for NET-EN and every 90 +/- 5 days for DMPA, the effects on various parameters studied were less with NET-EN. The lower-dose, nonoral hormonal RING had a lesser impact on carbohydrate metabolism and greater reduction of free androgen and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels than PILL treatment. Reducing the dose of EE in oral contraceptives from 30 mcg to 20 mcg minimizes their impact on renin substrate and hemostatic parameters. Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart-New York. These alterations in carbohydrate metabolism should have no clinical significance in healthy women. The metabolic effects were similar despite the lower total steroid dose of the gestodene preparation. Further larger studies are warranted. The lipoprotein, SHBG, and protein S and factor V differences are likely due to the lesser androgenicity of DSG allowing for a greater expression of the dose of estrogen. Levonorgestrel (100 microg) with ethinyl estradiol (20 microg) provides menstrual cycle control equivalent to that obtained with triphasic norethindrone with ethinyl estradiol (75% higher estrogen dose) with similar safety and tolerability. However, these changes were of small magnitude and levels remained well within the normal range in all subjects.

321,CD005083,"We concluded that topical application of crude undiluted honey could (1) faster eradication of bacterial infections, (2) reduce period of antibiotic use and hospital stay, (3) accelerate wound healing, (4) prevent wound dehiscence and need for re-suturing and (5) result in minimal scar formation. Additionally, effective desloughing significantly improves healing outcomes. Residual scars were noted in 8 per cent of patients treated with honey-impregnated gauze and in 16.6 per cent of cases treated with amniotic membrane (P < 0.001). Natural honey is extremely costeffective. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. These results support the proposition that there are clinical benefits from using honey in wound care, but further research is needed. Of the wounds treated with honey, 100 per cent healed within 15 days as against 50 per cent in the wounds treated with boiled potato peel dressings (mean 10.4 vs. 16.2 days). We suggest that in another study, the efficacy of honey with standardized level of antibacterial activity is evaluated against cutaneous leishmaniasis. No statistically significant difference was found for healing times after total toenail avulsion, although the marginal benefit of the honey dressing on these healing times warrants further investigation. Honey dressing improves wound healing, makes the wound sterile in lesser time, has a better outcome in terms of prevention of hypertrophic scarring and post-burn contractures, and decreases the need of debridement irrespective of time of admission, when compared to SSD dressing. Honey dressing is a safe alternative dressing for Wagner grade-II diabetic foot ulcers. Honey appears to be more effective than sugar in reducing bacterial contamination and promoting wound healing, and slightly less painful than sugar during dressing changes and motion. The availability of suitable allogenic blood is a potential problem when TE is employed. Thus in honey dressed wounds, early subsidence of acute inflammatory changes, better control of infection and quicker wound healing was observed while in the SSD treated wounds sustained inflammatory reaction was noted even on epithelialization. Relief of pain, a lower incidence of hypertrophic scar and postburn contracture, low cost and easy availability make honey an ideal dressing in the treatment of burns. Honey impregnated gauze dressed wounds showed healing earlier as compared to OpSite (mean 10.8 versus 15.3 days)."
322,CD005262,"The level of pain did not change significantly with either aspirin or pentoxifylline, but the walking distance was farther with the pentoxifylline group. We conclude that the decrease in red cell rigidity may have contributed to the increased walking distance. The benefit of drug plus physical therapy compared with exercise alone could be observed mainly in the first weeks of treatment and may wear off during long-term therapy. These ratios have 95% confidence limits of 0.72-1.34 and 0.74-1.25, respectively. Subjective side effects were reported by six patients in the pentoxifylline group and by three patients in the nylidrin HCl group. It is concluded that oxpentifylline , when taken in oral form at the dose used in this study, increased erythrocyte deformability without conferring any clinical or haemorrheological benefit to patients with intermittent claudication. Pentoxifylline and placebo had similar effects. For target patients, however, a multifactorial therapeutic approach, including the use of pentoxifylline, is justified. In conclusion, pentoxifylline proved more effective than the other drugs tested in: 1. improving distal pressure and resting microcirculatory blood flow; 2. increasing postexercise distal flow, ratios, and pressures and enabling faster recuperation of basal pulse rates; 3. increasing initial claudication distance in the strain test within the test group and achieving a greater absolute subjective claudication distance than that obtained using the other treatments. Results indicate good efficacy and tolerability. These results indicate that oral iloprost is not effective in improving exercise performance or quality of life in patients with PAD who have intermittent claudication. No adverse reactions were recorded during the trial. Thus the mechanisms involved in the pentoxifylline-treated group were different from those in the cilostazol-treated group, and require further study. Nausea was the only drug side effect noted. White the precise mode of therapeutic action requires clarification, pentoxifylline was well tolerated with minimal unwanted effects. In conclusion, PXF improved walking distance significantly better than placebo."

325,CD004376,"These data suggest that exercise should be prescribed as part of the treatment for knee osteoarthritis. The program was reasonably effective, but more attention should be paid to proactive followup interventions and to the selection of participants. The use of a home-based pedometer-driven program to increase physical activity, strength, and function in this population warrants further research. A longitudinal study with a larger sample size is now needed to confirm the potential use of tai chi exercise in arthritis management. The lack of improvement in patients who received only telephone contact suggests that improvements are not just due to psychosocial effects because of contact with the therapist.

An intervention that combines spouse-assisted coping skills training and exercise training can improve physical fitness, strength, pain coping, and self-efficacy in patients suffering from pain due to osteoarthritis. Dynamic or isometric resistance training improves functional ability and reduces knee joint pain of patients with knee OA. The physiotherapy programme tested in this trial was no more effective than regular contact with a therapist at reducing pain and disability. High intensity, home based strength training can produce substantial improvements in strength, pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee OA. UK National Research Register N0286046917; Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN55376150 [controlled-trials.com] . The overall results suggest that this program is effective for older persons with osteoarthritis of the knee and that it could contribute to maintaining their independence and improving their quality of life. An integrated therapy deals with the extra- and intraarticular progressive pathologic changes, and kinesiologic management of OA is suggested for the management of knee OA. Our findings document the feasibility and efficacy of conditioning exercise for people who have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Access to either hydrotherapy or Tai Chi classes can provide large and sustained improvements in physical function for many older, sedentary individuals with chronic hip or knee OA. The combination of modest weight loss plus moderate exercise provides better overall improvements in self-reported measures of function and pain and in performance measures of mobility in older overweight and obese adults with knee OA compared with either intervention alone. A combination of manual physical therapy and supervised exercise yields functional benefits for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and may delay or prevent the need for surgical intervention. Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Isokinetic exercise is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for knee osteoarthritis, but a much less costly education program also showed some benefits. Responsiveness to this 8 week intervention was modified by loss of medial joint space width. The size of the effects is medium and small, respectively. Further study of exercise effects should include both clinical and biologic parameters to examine the outcome of exercise as a therapeutic intervention in OA of the knee. There was no difference between the 2 groups at 12 months. The experimental group significantly increased in all strength measures, while the control group increased in only right leg flexion and left leg extension across the training period. As shown by the high compliance and low dropout frequency, such a program is feasible even in patients with severe OA of the knee. Addition of a progressive exercise program to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory therapy in patients with knee OA can improve measures of activity and activity related pain more than medication alone. A program of supervised fitness walking and patient education can improve functional status without worsening pain or exacerbating arthritis-related symptoms in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. These benefits indicate that this low-cost intervention may hold great promise as one of a growing number of public health intervention strategies for older adults in the United States with osteoarthritis."

The conceptualization and applicability of tele-cognitive rehabilitation, its implications for persons with ABI, and future studies in this research area are also discussed. The pattern of results supports the separation of functions in switching attention suggested by a neural network model, and establishes minimal aids necessary for remediating deficits associated with ABI. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00071643. These studies provide both experimental and clinical support for the efficacy of GMT toward the treatment of executive functioning deficits that compromise independence in patients with brain damage. The need for a larger study with more treatment sessions is discussed. However, these benefits were not transferable to real-life situations. The ability to use internal compensatory strategies may be a significant confound in research examining the effects of the various cognitive rehabilitation intervention methods. This new programme can be further developed to extend a better carryover treatment effect to functional improvement in daily activities. Conclusion: More than one year after a stroke, systematic WM training can significantly improve WM and attention. 2000;283:3075-3081 Although control patients' satisfaction and subjective well-being were at the same level, the experimental group had better abilities to set and accomplish realistic goals, to plan, initiate, and regulate a series of real-life tasks, and to resume previous roles with respect to work, social relations, leisure activities, and mobility. The results show the effectiveness of comprehensive holistic NP rehabilitation for improving community functioning and quality of life after TBI compared with standard rehabilitation."

329,CD000143,"We were unable to demonstrate a clear difference in extubation outcome by use of CPAP administered via an endotracheal or nasopharyngeal tube when compared to direct extubation from low-rate IMV in VLBW infants. There was no significant difference in the failure rate of extubation among infants randomised to receive nasal CPAP or headbox oxygen in either the acute or chronic respiratory distress groups. We conclude that nasopharyngeal CPAP does not improve the likelihood of successful extubation of very low birth weight infants who are ready for extubation within the first 2 weeks of life. Data indicate that using selected clinical criteria for elective extubation of neonates weighing less than 1 kg, NCPAP facilitates successful extubation. These results suggest that application of N-CPAP to a preset protocol for extubation can achieve a better success rate of early extubation in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants. In conclusion, this study showed that a short period of nasal CPAP is not associated with a reduction in reventilation. Postextubation N-CPAP has a striking beneficial effect on respiratory function and prevention of atelectasis. Elective use of nasal continuous positive airways pressure post-extubation is not universally tolerated, but does reduce the need for additional support. The benefits of NCPAP do not seem to be associated with an increased incidence of unwanted side effects."
330,CD004481,"Few serious side effects were encountered, and colchicine clearly merits long-term study in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. It is necessary, however, to further confirm the efficacy of colchicine by examining histological changes and following the patients for longer periods. These data suggest that UDCA frequently is superior to colchicine and especially to placebo in the treatment of PBC. The addition of colchicine to ursodeoxycholic acid in patients with symptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis results in a small but significant reduction of disease progress. Both colchicine and methotrexate improved biochemical test results and symptoms in primary biliary cirrhosis, but the response to methotrexate was greater. We conclude that colchicine is of clinical benefit to patients with primary biliary cirrhosis as judged by improvement in alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities as well as a tendency for stabilization of bilirubin values. In conclusion, this study suggests that colchicine appears to provide a slight advantage relative to UDCA alone in patients with nonadvanced PBC. However, the failure of colchicine to reduce hepatic inflammation and fibrosis leaves uncertain the effect of the drug on the longterm outcome of this disease."
331,CD005237,"However, the differences among treatments were small. Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Greater weight gain was associated with olanzapine than with risperidone treatment. Stable elderly patients with chronic schizophrenia receiving appropriate doses of risperidone or olanzapine over an 8-week period experienced significant reductions in the severity of psychotic and extrapyramidal symptoms, with a relatively low risk of side effects. However, severity of OCS was associated with duration of treatment with olanzapine. Despite the relatively small sample size, our study suggests that olanzapine has a superior risk:benefit profile compared to risperidone. Further evaluation is warranted to confirm these findings. Olanzapine seemed to have a risk-versus-benefit advantage. A larger sample replication study is necessary to confirm and generalize the observations of this study and begin evaluation of the implications of this change to cerebral function and quality of life for people with schizophrenia."

335,CD003264,"Infants with CRF and growth retardation despite good metabolic and nutritional control benefit from GH treatment without adverse effects during 12 months of therapy. Treatment is best started before growth retardation becomes considerable. This suggests that this higher GH dose may be beneficial for children with severe growth retardation secondary to CRI. The use of rhGH in growth-retarded children with chronic renal failure may facilitate the achievement of the inherent growth potential of such children. In conclusion, rhGH is effective in improving the growth velocity of pediatric renal allograft recipients and is not associated with an increase in adverse events. The low start dose (2 IU/m2/ day) was of no advantage compared to the high dose. Phosphate, ALP, PTH, and insulin increased during the first year of treatment. These observations suggest that, in children with growth failure associated with chronic renal failure: (i) IGFBP-2, and not IGFBP-3, is likely to be a growth inhibitor; (ii) rhGH stimulates catch-up growth in part by increasing serum levels of IGF peptides; and (iii) linear growth is influenced by the balance between growth stimulating IGFs and growth inhibitory IGFBPs. Our results show that sustained improvement of height can be achieved with GH in severely growth-retarded adolescents after renal transplantation. Thus, growth hormone therapy improves linear growth and maintains bone mass, but does not favorably affect bone formation rates in stable pediatric renal allograft recipients."

337,CD004185,"These findings suggest that patients affected by major depression with anxiety and/or agitation were effectively and safely treated with FX without increasing risks. suppression of REM sleep. Venlafaxine therefore proved to be significantly more effective than fluoxetine in improving depressive symptoms and concomitant anxiety. Fluoxetine was associated more frequently with weight loss (p = .002) and less frequently with dizziness (p = .04) than trazodone. These results are discussed in the context of selecting between nortriptyline and fluoxetine for a particular depressed patient. A significantly smaller percentage of fluoxetine than imipramine patients terminated therapy because of adverse experiences. This study does not support previous claims of specific adverse effects of fluoxetine on anxiety and suicidality. In this study, fluoxetine relieved the symptoms of major depressive illness effectively and significantly better than placebo and was better tolerated than imipramine. Significantly fewer fluoxetine-treated patients discontinued due to adverse events than did imipramine-treated patients (7% vs. 30%, respectively). It was concluded that fluoxetine provides effective antidepressant activity with fewer and less troublesome side effects than imipramine. Fluoxetine treatment resulted in weight loss, whereas imipramine treatment resulted in a slight but significant weight increase. In this study, both tianeptine and fluoxetine exhibited a good efficacy and safety. Normal cyclical ovulation, and estrogen release may have a clinically relevant pharmacodynamic interaction with serotonergic antidepressants. Compared to imipramine, fluoxetine was associated with fewer complaints of dry mouth, constipation, and dizziness. At the time of the study, FF1 = $US0.1993. Evidence that moclobemide may be more effective requires confirmation in a larger comparative study incorporating a placebo control group. It is likely that fluoxetine will be marketed with a proposed dose range lower than the one used here. Fluoxetine was as effective as imipramine in this population of inpatients. In line with analogous Western reports, the safety of mirtazapine and fluoxetine was comparable for our depressed Chinese patients; however, slightly different side effect profiles were noted for the 2 drugs in our study. The results suggest that early signs of response to fluoxetine are not dependent on achieving steady-state levels of the drug. Fluoxetine was found to have a more marked therapeutic effect than that of amineptine: better efficacy, fewer side-effects, and quicker and better improvement on the self evaluation scales. It was concluded that fluoxetine is as effective as phenelzine in the treatment of atypical depression, but produces fewer adverse effects and is better tolerated. In summary, fluvoxamine and fluoxetine were equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms, but the two drugs displayed slightly different side-effect profiles. Regardless of how strict the definition of response, we found fluoxetine to be as effective as doxepin in our group of melancholic outpatients. The 2 antidepressants proved to be suitable for the long-term treatment of depression in the elderly and to be devoid of detrimental effects on the tested cognitive functions. These data indicate that duloxetine is efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated and safe. Based on remission criteria (HAM-D < 7 or CGI of 1), venlafaxine was superior to fluoxetine. Further studies, including parallel placebo-controlled comparisons with nefazodone, are needed to further test this hypothesis. We found that mirtazapine was as well tolerated as fluoxetine and significantly more effective after 3 and 4 weeks of therapy. Important differences were found in the side-effects profile of each group, their incidence being significantly lower and tending to disappear during the course of treatment in the group of patients treated with fluoxetine. Amitriptyline did not significantly alter the STIs. Once-daily venlafaxine XR is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of major depression and concomitant anxiety and provides evidence for superiority over fluoxetine. Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. During the study, the safety of the two treatments was comparable. Side-effect profiles were not significantly different between groups except for a significantly greater frequency of dose-related increase in heart rate > or = 100 bpm in milnacipran recipients and a significantly greater weight loss in fluoxetine recipients. However, both a survival analysis and a new measure that takes account of prolonged periods of noncompliance distinguished between the treatments and was associated with improvement in both groups. In fact clinical efficacy seems to remain comparable while side-effects are significantly less frequent. Both sertraline and fluoxetine were well tolerated with no significant differences between treatments. The Hypericum preparation tested in this study is therapeutically equivalent to fluoxetine and is therefore a rational alternative to synthetic antidepressants. The results are important when striving to maximize compliance with pharmacotherapy in order to minimize recidivism and associated psychological and economic morbidity. In summary, our results, although limited by the lack of a significant difference from placebo in treatment outcome, suggest that the SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine have comparable antidepressant and antianxiety efficacies among depressed outpatients, as well as similar safety and tolerability profiles. Side effects were present in most patients on the two active drugs; those on fluoxetine experienced nausea and vomiting, and those on mianserin drowsiness. Patients taking fluoxetine reported less side-effects than those taking amitriptyline. The results of this study suggest that venlafaxine XR is as well-tolerated as fluoxetine but may have some efficacy advantages over fluoxetine. The opportunity was taken to compare the relationship of some standard measures of depressive illness, two observer based--Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979)--and a self-rating scale--Levine Pilowsky Depression questionnaire (Pilowsky et al., 1969). The results indicate that reboxetine is an effective and well tolerated antidepressant, being more effective than fluoxetine in patients with severe depression, and more effective in terms of social functioning in those patients who achieved remission. Sexual dysfunction was reported in two patients taking fluoxetine. Subjects taking sertraline, 100 mg, and fluoxetine, 20 mg, demonstrated an earlier treatment response compared with subjects taking sertraline, 50 mg. For patients without a positive response at 6 weeks, an increased antidepressant dose resulted in remission for a substantial proportion of patients when assessed 4 weeks later. A daily dosage of 300 mg of moclobemide and 20 mg of fluoxetine would thus appear to be comparable both in antidepressant efficacy and tolerability. These led to abandonment of treatment and therefore premature withdrawal from the study in 8 cases. Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. These results support the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine in comparison with fluoxetine for treating outpatients with major depression. Weight gain was detected only in patients receiving amitriptyline. Separate analysis of patients who had received an adequate trial of medication indicated a trend toward relatively more fluoxetine-treated patients meeting clinical criteria for resolved depression. Improvement was not only seen in dimensions measuring depression or mental health but also in other dimensions. Numbers of patients reporting side-effects were similar but the profiles of side-effects were different, with more patients on amitriptyline reporting anticholinergic and intolerable side-effects. Both bupropion and fluoxetine demonstrated similar efficacy in relieving depression and accompanying symptoms of anxiety, and both exhibited a similar, favorable safety profile. These differential sleep EEG effects are consistent with the notion that nefazodone and fluoxetine may have somewhat different modes and spectra of action. The results of this study indicate that venlafaxine is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of major depression at doses of 37.5 or 75 mg twice daily and not significantly different from fluoxetine 20 or 40 mg once daily. Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Tolerance of both drugs was judged to be high. Furthermore, in cases where, for various reasons, the treatment of choice is noradrenergic, it may be worthwhile to consider a supplementary serotonergic drug to improve memory deficits. The authors hypothesize that fluoxetine 20 mg/day may be an ineffective dosage of the drug or that fluoxetine has a slower onset of antidepressant action than does trazodone. There were no haematological or clinical chemistry changes. Improvement in overall depression and in associated insomnia was achieved by most patients regardless of baseline insomnia. Venlafaxine 75 mg daily is comparable to fluoxetine, but at 150 mg daily, it may be superior to fluoxetine in outpatients with major depression who do not respond early to treatment. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The results support previous studies which suggest fluoxetine's superior side-effect profile and the approximate antidepressant equivalence of fluoxetine and TCAs. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea and vomiting in both groups. Pramipexole helped safely alleviate the symptoms of depression at 1.0 mg per day and especially in those patients who could tolerate the escalation to 5 mg per day. These data suggest that both agents have a similar efficacy and tolerability but that moclobemide has an earlier onset of antidepressive action. By contrast, 13.5% of sertraline-treated patients discontinued prematurely because of clinical improvement, compared with 10.7% of fluoxetine-treated patients. Each treatment was similarly effective in improving depression in this subtype of patients with anxious depression. As expected, in the amisulpride group endocrine-like adverse events in female patients were the most common, while nausea, dyspepsia, anorexia and insomnia occurred more frequently with fluoxetine. The amitriptyline-treated group had complaints of dry mouth and dizziness on standing; the fluoxetine-treated group of sleep disturbances, nausea, and headaches. Although there was no difference in the rate of adverse events experienced, fluoxetine-treated patients lost significantly more body weight over the 12-week trial than did sertraline-treated patients, whereas the latter group exhibited significantly more "shaking. " Common side effects of doxepin were dry mouth, drowsiness/sedation, constipation, and dizziness/lightheadedness. The most frequently reported side effects were nausea and nervousness for fluoxetine, and dry mouth, dizziness, and drowsiness for amitriptyline. Anticipation may be a key dimension to be more precisely explored in specific psychopharmacological protocols with antidepressants. The results confirm the effectiveness and good tolerability of fluoxetine in the treatment of depressive disorders. Paroxetine appears to produce an earlier improvement in agitation and psychic anxiety symptoms compared with fluoxetine. Despite earlier data that SSRIs might be the treatment of choice, fluoxetine appeared to be no better than imipramine in the treatment of atypical depression, although fluoxetine was better tolerated than imipramine. Sertraline and fluoxetine were equally effective and well tolerated in patients with major depression and associated anxiety. Severe depression tended to be treated by psychiatrists; general practitioners prescribed additional medication less frequently. Differences in cognitive performance effects deserve further investigation. A larger study is warranted. The present study suggests that the link between efficacy, side effects and compliance or adherence is more complex than is generally believed and that early termination and non-adherence seem to be determined by different factors. Futhermore, both antidepressants are well tolerated but possess different adverse event profiles. Overall tolerance was similar for the two treatments. In fact, the only statistically significant difference found was in weight change: weight loss in the fluoxetine group and weight gain in the maprotiline group. Fluoxetine showed some specific effects on sleep continuity (potentially dose related) as indicated by the significant increase in the number of awakenings and in stage shifts, without interfering with the therapeutic response. These differences in efficacy favoring fluoxetine could result from the selection of a dose of milnacipran below the optimal therapeutic dose for this type of psychiatric patients or to the administration of the compounds in single daily intakes, whereas milnacipran possesses a plasma elimination half-life of only 7 h. These results provide supporting evidence of the comparable efficacy of moclobemide and fluoxetine and the better tolerability of moclobemide when used in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Since fluoxetine was far better tolerated, it is a promising alternative for this frequent and disabling condition."

341,CD000369,"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Beta interferon at the suggested regimen is well tolerated but does not seem to significantly influence the natural course of acute hepatitis C. Serum hepatitis C virus RNA became undetectable in 10 of 11 treated and in only 1 of 12 control patients, which suggests that interferon prevents the progression of acute non-A, non-B hepatitis to chronicity by eradicating HCV. It is concluded that therapy with IFN can reduce the risk of chronic infection in patients with acute HCV infection. In summary, a 3-mo course of interferon-alpha in acute hepatitis C is safe and might have some effect in diminishing disease activity only during the treatment period; however, and probably because of a small sample size, no benefit of interferon-alpha in the long-term outcome of this disease was demonstrated."

343,CD001168,"Topical cyclosporine appears no more effective than steroid in the treatment of oral lichen planus. The conclusion of this study is that PUVA seems to be effective in the treatment of OLP and should be considered in severe cases of OLP. Topical intralesional BCG-PSN injection is as effective as TA for erosive OLP, which suggests that topical intralesional BCG-PSN injection can be a promising therapeutic alternative for erosive OLP, especially for those insensitive, or even resistant, to glucocorticoids. (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Our results suggest that Ignatia has a beneficial effect in treatment of OLP in selected patients. However, relapses occurred frequently within 3-9 weeks of the cessation of treatment. Topical HA gel may be a useful addition to the treatment option for OLP. Pimecrolimus cream 1% effectively treats EOLP with long-lasting therapeutic effects and is therefore a promising therapeutic option for EOLP. It may be a useful and convenient alternative either as a monotherapy or to achieve rapid symptomatic relief during periods of exacerbations. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Further study of 1% pimecrolimus as therapy for OELP is warranted since it was shown to be effective, relatively safe, and well tolerated by patients within the limits of this short-term study. The results from this study suggest that topical application of fluocinonide in an adhesive base is a safe and effective drug to reduce signs and symptoms in oral lichen planus. Therefore, AV gel can be considered a safe alternative treatment for patients with OLP. However, other studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this treatment before it can be recommended for use in clinical practice. The daily cost of ciclosporin is more than five times higher than clobetasol. FP is more acceptable to patients than BSP because of the convenience of the spray form. A larger concentration of the active molecules cannot further improve the therapeutic findings or optimize the obtained results in a significant manner. Although effective in preventing iatrogenic candidosis, the addition of miconazole to topical steroid treatment does not improve the efficacy of the therapy. Curcuminoids at this dose were well tolerated and the results suggest that for future studies a larger sample size, a higher dose and/or longer duration of curcuminoids administration should be considered; however, for the next step, an RCT of a shorter duration, using a higher dose of curcuminoids, and without an initial course of prednisone, should be considered. As a topical preparation, cyclosporine may be useful in the treatment of oral lichen planus and possibly other cutaneous disorders. The finding of systemic levels of pimecrolimus after mucosal applications necessitates long-term study because it seems that long-term application is required to maintain clinical improvement. Our results suggest that the new topical drug delivery system (formulation A) may enhance, at least in terms of symptom remission and compliance, the effectiveness of clobetasol propionate at a dose of 0.025% in OLP therapy. 22)."
344,CD007718,"This IC trial improved disease knowledge, and treatment adherence, after 1 year of intervention, suggesting that these factors may play a role in the prevention of severe COPD exacerbations triggering hospital admissions. Our findings will need to be confirmed in a larger randomized trial with more mature Web and personal digital assistant tools, use of a control group, and longer follow-up. Further research is needed to determine the role of telemonitoring and televisit services for this kind of patients. This study has demonstrated that virtual visits between a skilled home healthcare nurse and chronically ill patients at home can improve patient outcome at lower cost than traditional skilled face-to-face home healthcare visits. These programs can provide timely and quality home health nursing care with VVs augmenting traditional home visits. In conclusion, this trial demonstrates that a standardised integrated care intervention, based on shared care arrangements among different levels of the system with support of information technologies, effectively prevents hospitalisations for exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. This approach of care can be implemented within normal practice. This technology can thus be an asset for patients and providers. In regard to patient perceptions of home telecare, patients were satisfied with the technology and the way that care was delivered via this modality. Findings from this preliminary study may support the use and feasibility of state-of-the-art methodologies in carefully selected subpopulations outside the confines of the hospital or clinic setting. The study needs to be replicated in other setting to strengthen its external validity. The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group seems to have a greater advantage from tele-assistance."

Conclusions: Elimination of the presumed structural risk from the dental occlusion appeared to significantly reduce the incidence of temporomandibular disorders in a select group of young subjects.

346,CD008493,"Statin pretreatment reduces myocardial damage after coronary surgery and could improve both short- and long-term results. In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass, the administration of simvastatin doses not produce any changes in the inflammatory response as measured by the levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and SIRS score, nor does it reduce the complications after cardiac surgery. We believe that routine preoperative use of fluvastatin should be carefully considered. Pretreatment with atorvastatin significantly increases the amount of EPCs after CPB, by a mechanism independent of plasma levels of cytokines and cholesterol. Administration of atorvastatin 20 mg/day, initiated 1 week before elective off-pump CABG and continued in the postoperative period, significantly decreases postoperative AF. Pretreatment with atorvastatin significantly reduces cytokine release and neutrophil adhesion to the venous endothelium in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. Pretreatment with atorvastatin significantly reduced the occurrence of postoperative AF after off-pump CABG. These data show that acute preoperative statin therapy fails to limit the inflammatory response to CPB; however, the data also document a major upregulation of NF-kappaB during cardiac operations, thereby providing a sound rationale for interventions targeted at inactivating this key component of the inflammatory cascade. Pravastatin;s effects on the expression of these pivotal inflammatory mediators strongly support its well-timed use in CPB. These results may influence practice patterns with regard to adjuvant pharmacological therapy before cardiac surgery."

NIV should be considered as a new and useful systematic approach to weaning in patients with ACRF who are difficult to wean. So it is an efficient strategy to be generalized.

CSII is a practical, safe and effective method of maintaining maternal normoglycemia in pregnancy but for the present we cannot consider it superior to ICT in the treatment of pregnant diabetic women."
354,CD001418,"None of the other parameters showed a statistically significant advantage for combination chemotherapy, but the combinations caused more hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. The platinum drug antitumor effect is a critically important therapeutic feature of this combination. Since the carboplatin regimen group did not require hydration, or the use diuretics or antiemetics, these results suggested that carboplatin is more useful in the treatment of ovarian cancer than cisplatin. Cell differentiation and volume of postoperative disease did not influence response. Carboplatin-cyclophosphamide proved to have a significantly better therapeutic index than cisplatin-cyclophosphamide in patients with stage III (suboptimal) and stage IV ovarian cancer. The authors conclude that for patients with large (greater than 2 cm) residual disease, there is no compelling evidence that initial combination therapy is superior to aggressive single alkylating agent treatment. The continued fall in survival curves after 48 months suggests that current therapy regimens are not dramatically changing long-term survival rates. In women with advanced ovarian cancer, initial therapy with a cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimen resulted in higher clinical complete response rates and longer time to failure compared with initial therapy with a single, oral alkylating agent; however, the benefits of this approach were confined to women older than 50 years of age at diagnosis, and there was no significant difference in survival. Thus, the addition of cisplatin improves the chemotherapy of advanced ovarian carcinoma. Two additional patients, who had microscopic disease removed at second-look laparotomy, seem to have been rescued by this procedure. The toxicity suffered by patients treated with high-dose cisplatin was severe, and in 15 patients cisplatin therapy was stopped because of unacceptable toxicity. Further experience is needed to indicate whether or not carboplatin should completely displace cisplatin in the clinical treatment of ovarian cancer. Disease stage, performance status and age were identified as important prognostic variables for both survival and time to treatment failure. The mature data from this study of patients with advanced ovarian cancer show that cisplatin and carboplatin have similar long-term survival results. The prognostic role of residual disease after initial surgery, complete remission at second-look laparotomy, tumour stage and performance status was confirmed. Survival was longer in patients whose disease responded to either therapeutic regimen. However, more patients in the CA regimen had no macroscopic disease left after surgery than in CAP regimen (11 versus 6) and more patients in the CAP arm dose reductions and schedule delays than in the CA arm (61.1% versus 38.2%). Patients (likely to be stage III or IV) with greater residual disease should receive treosulfan plus cisplatinum. Both cisplatin and carboplatin are likely to have a role in future treatment strategies. This response rate was not enhanced by the addition of FU or FU and AC and not substantially different than the response rate of AC, FU, and CY. Prednimustine can produce durable responses in advanced ovarian cancer using a schedule that results in negligible toxicity. The authors also discuss some observations on a possible salvage therapy. No other statistical differences were found. This may best be achieved by determining the initial dose based on renal function, and then adjusting subsequent doses according to nadir blood counts."
355,CD003038,"Adjuvant glycopeptide therapy from the outset in the treatment of febrile granulocytopenic patients did not seem worthwhile. Meropenem is more effective for pediatric cancer patients at the high risk of severe infection. Latamoxef appears to be an effective antibiotic for the treatment of neutropenic patients with infection. Given the small number of patients randomized and the single-center nature of this study, these results must be cautiously interpreted. However, ceftriaxone/gentamicin was more cost effective. Meropenem monotherapy seemed as effective and safe as amikacin plus ceftazidime for the empirical treatment of neutropenic cancer patients with fever. Serious adverse effects, causing preliminary withdrawal of therapy, have not been observed. It is concluded that aminoglycosides are not necessary for the empiric treatment of infectious complications in granulocytopenic patients if antibacterial prophylaxis has been given beforehand. In our epidemiological setting, the initial empiric combination therapy was not associated with improved outcomes when compared with initial monotherapy. No statistical difference between standard antibiotic therapy and latamoxef was seen in this subset of patients. Imipenem/cilastatine and the combination of ceftazidime with amikacin were equally effective in the treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. Cefepime appears to be a candidate for monotherapy in febrile neutropenic cancer patients. This study demonstrated that imipenem-cilastatin monotherapy and combination therapy of sulbactam-cefoperazone plus amikacin were equally effective empiric therapy for febrile granulocytopenic cancer patients. The low overall success rates with both treatments concur with those of other recent studies and are probably due to a combination of several factors, including the adoption of strict assessment criteria. Empirical initial therapy with imipenem may be a valuable alternative to combination therapy for neutropenic fever episodes. It is concluded that imipenem/cilastatin is a promising candidate for monotherapy of bacterial infections in neutropenic cancer patients. Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Single-agent therapy with imipenem is as effective as more conventional combination antibiotic therapy for the empirical treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients with cancer. Piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy is significantly more effective and cost-efficient than ceftriaxone plus gentamicin as first-line therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies. Ceftazidime alone was as effective but safer than the combination of piperacillin and tobramycin for the empiric treatment of febrile, neutropenic patients, even those with profound and prolonged granulocytopenia. Less adverse reactions, lower number of infections, less frequent medical procedures, elimination of the potentially toxic aminoglycosides and lower cost of therapy advocate the use of ceftazidime monotherapy. The use of piperacillin as a single agent in the treatment of serious bacterial infections is not advocated, and the addition of an aminoglycoside to prevent emergence of resistance during empirical therapy of such infections is strongly recommended. The main determining factors for the choice of treatment of febrile neutropenic children, especially in a developing country, are cost, presence of indwelling catheter and the bacterial flora of the unit, as well as efficacy. It should be considered an appropriate option for this group of patients at high risk for infections. In conclusion, ceftazidime alone was as effective as cefotaxime + tobramycin in the first line treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. Ceftriaxone would appear to be effective as initial monotherapy in the treatment of bacterial infections in severely neutropenic children. Monotherapy with ceftazidime is as effective as when used in combination with an aminoglycoside in neutropenia. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel Therapy with IPM/CS monotherapy was as effective as a combination regimen. This study suggests that ceftazidime as monotherapy in febrile neutropenic children may be inferior to combination therapy for optimal clinical response in these patients. The data suggest that imipenem-cilastatin should be considered for initial empiric therapy of presumed bacterial infection in neutropenic cancer patients. Combination of amikacin with PIP/TAZO did not improve treatment success, but it may increase nephrotoxicity. We conclude that ceftazidime (+/- flucloxacillin) is as efficacious as azlocillin plus amikacin (+/- flucloxacillin) in the empirical antibiotic management of such patients and is associated with a lower incidence of moderate to severe hypokalemia. Meropenem monotherapy was as effective as piperacillin plus amikacin combination in the empirical treatment of neutropenic fever in children with lymphoma and solid tumors. Cefepime monotherapy is as effective as ceftazidime + amikacin combination in febrile neutropenia of pediatric cancer patients and must be preferred due to shorter defervescence of fever, shorter hospitalization, and lower therapy cost. Monotherapy being both simpler to administer and less toxic seems therefore to be the logical choice although the period of empiric therapy must be fully exploited in order to improve diagnosis and therefore antimicrobial management. Ceftazidime administered as monotherapy proved as effective as the cefotaxime-amikacin combination in the empirical first-line treatment of febrile episodes in leukaemic patients with neutropenia. and other more resistant pathogens needs further assessment with a larger number of patients. We conclude that imipenem monotherapy represents an acceptable alternative to piperacillin plus gentamicin as empirical therapy of the febrile neutropenic patient. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Urinary beta-NAG increased only in the tobramycin and cefuroxime group. This study confirms that monotherapy with meropenem is as effective as the combination of ceftazidime plus amikacin for the empiric treatment of fever in persistently granulocytopenic cancer patients, and both regimens were well tolerated. To define the definitive value of piperacillin/ tazobactam as a monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients a large randomized trial is warranted. PTA was as effective as carbapenem monotherapy as an initial empirical regimen in febrile neutropenic episodes of pediatric hematological malignancies. Further study is warranted for patients with severe neutropenia and leukemia who may benefit from dual therapy. This study suggests that meropenem monotherapy might be as effective as combination therapy with ceftazidime and amikacin for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic patients."
356,CD006028,"hANP should be part of the postoperative care for cardiac surgery. We found it to be effective for postoperative hemostasis and for preventing ischemic reperfusion injury. Further studies, using higher doses, will be required to define the value of urodilatin for prevention of renal impairment after liver transplantation. It is concluded that parenteral ANP increases CCr and reduces need for dialysis in patients with established intrinsic ARF. These results imply that renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the incidence of postoperative HT and RD, and suggest that hANP infusion is a simple, reliable, and effective method for management during the immediate period after AAA operations. It is therefore considered that hANP might not only be effective for overcoming some major shortcomings of cardiopulmonary bypass, but also might be effective to attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury, protect the myocardium, have an anti-arrhythmic effect, and suppress left ventricular remodeling. The results suggest that the technique is useful for the management of hemodynamics and water-sodium retention after cardiopulmonary bypass. hANP can satisfactorily compensate for the shortcomings of CPB by decreasing the peripheral vascular resistance, suppressing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and exerting a strong diuretic effect. We conclude that URO seems to be a new approach for the treatment of therapy-resistant postoperative ARF following LTx. Infusion of h-ANP at a rate of 50 ng.kg(-1).min(-1) enhances renal excretory function, decreases the probability of dialysis, and improves dialysis-free survival in early, ischemic acute renal dysfunction after complicated cardiac surgery. We conclude that Urodilatin does not reduce the incidence of acute renal failure and the subsequent requirement for hemofiltration / hemodialysis in our patient population, but seems to reduce the duration of hemofiltration and frequency of hemodialysis compared to the placebo group. Further prospective clinical trials are needed to answer the question whether a different patient collective or a prophylactic administration of Ularitide are more promising approaches in the clinical setting of oliguric acute renal failure. In conclusion, administration of intravenous anaritide before and during a radiocontrast study did not reduce the incidence of RCIN in patients with preexisting chronic renal failure, with or without diabetes mellitus. Continuous infusion of synthetic human atrial natriuretic peptide might be effective for preventing acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis after liver transplantation. This well-characterized population with oliguric acute renal failure had an overall high morbidity and mortality. However, anaritide may improve dialysis-free survival in patients with oliguria and may worsen it in patients without oliguria who have acute tubular necrosis. On the basis of these results it would appear that urodilatin is an effective drug for the treatment of incipient oliguric acute renal failure following cardiac surgery and for avoiding haemodialysis/haemofiltration. This clinical study under double blind conditions revealed that the addition of urodilatin to the standard diuretic therapy of low-dose dopamine and furosemide failed to improve renal function in patients with established acute renal failure and that urodilatin did not eliminate the need for apparatus-based renal replacement treatment. Mannitol may induce ANP release, thus contributing to mannitol's renal effects."
357,CD002009,"We conclude that tobramycin given in a daily single dose (with the advantage of being more practical in a home environment) has an efficacy equal to that of three daily doses in terms of elective antipseudomonal therapy in clinically stable patients with CF. Once-daily dosing should be used with careful monitoring of safety and efficacy until large multicentre studies confirm these encouraging results. Once daily tobramycin combined with three injections of ceftazidime is safe and effective for the treatment of pseudomonas exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients. The once daily regimen might be less nephrotoxic in children."
358,CD004751,"Australian Clinical Trials Registry, www.actr.org.au, ACTR N012607000241437, I. Laparoscopy should be the elective treatment for women with dermoid cysts, because it has many advantages for the patient and lower costs for the national health system. It should be the first choice and may help to reduce postoperative complications. Minilaparotomy can be considered a mini-invasive approach as well, with acceptable operative and postoperative outcomes, and is a suitable alternative in case of contraindications to laparoscopy. There were no recurrences of teratomas in both arms of the study, suggesting that laparoscopy has the same efficacy as laparotomy. Operative laparoscopy should replace laparotomy in the management of benign ovarian masses. After careful patient evaluation, management of anechoic, unilocular adnexal cysts by operative laparoscopy significantly reduces both the intensity of postoperative pain and the length of convalescence compared with laparotomy. We conclude that operative laparoscopy is a safe procedure for the removal of dermoid ovarian cysts and is as effective as laparotomy."
359,CD004611,"Although the small sample size does not allow any conclusion to be drawn concerning the efficacy of L. plantarum in patients with RCDAD, these results may contribute to the ongoing discussion about the benefits of probiotics in patients with RCDAD and encourage the performance of larger multicentre studies. CONCLUSIONS--The combination of standard antibiotics and S boulardii was shown to be an effective and safe therapy for these patients with recurrent CDD; no benefit of S boulardii was demonstrated for those with an initial episode of CDD. Comparison of data from this trial with data from previous studies indicates that recurrent CDD may respond to a short course of high-dose vancomycin or to longer courses of low-dose vancomycin when either is combined with S. boulardii."
360,CD006161,"All infants were in excellent condition (1-minute Apgar score greater than or equal to 8). Fetal gasometric parameters did not change even when maternal parameters changed, induced by hyperoxia, during cesarean section under spinal block. Breathing supplemental oxygen or not during elective cesarean delivery of healthy parturients under spinal anesthesia does not have a significant effect on neonatal well-being. We conclude that breathing high FIO2 modestly increased fetal oxygenation but caused a concomitant increase in oxygen free radical activity in both mother and fetus. It is concluded that maternal hyperoxia improves fetal oxygen stores and acid-base status during cesarean section under epidural anesthesia. Our data do not support the routine administration of supplementary oxygen during elective Caesarean section for this purpose. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) It was found that use of the facemask impeded communication. The effect of maternal supplementary oxygen on the newborn has been demonstrated by a cerebral oximeter monitor and supported by umbilical cord blood gas analysis and Apgar scores."
361,CD001332,"Optimum effect was achieved when baclofen was administered in the early stages of disease, before major disabilities became permanent. Side effects were generally mild and transient. Both THC and plant-extract treatment worsened the participant's global impression. Tizanidine may well serve as an alternate antispastic agent, alone or in combination with other agents. Larger scale studies are warranted to confirm these findings. With reference to undesired side effects quantitative and qualitative differences could be established, in which Tetrazepam showed the most favourable benefit/risk ratio. Each drug had different side effects which suggest indications and contraindications for its use in spastic patients. Preference of either drug is tempered principally by side-effects. Enhancement by threonine of glycinergic postsynaptic inhibition of the motor reflex arc in the spinal cord may represent a non-sedating, nontoxic approach to the management of spasticity in multiple sclerosis. Patient and physician perception of improvement demonstrated more consistent differences between groups than did the Ashworth Scale, perhaps because of inexperience with this measure or failure to consider time between drug administration and assessment. Thus, tizanidine is a well tolerated and effective muscle relaxant, the antispastic efficacy of which is well maintained over time, and it promises to be particularly useful in the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. According to these results, tizanidine provides a new therapeutic alternative in the treatment of spasticity. This is discussed in the light of the fact that no significant difference was found for the individual symptoms or side-effects. The treatment was well tolerated. Added to the similar findings of an earlier double-blind controlled study of divided doses, the results suggest that this special feature of ketazolam provides a unique flexibility that may be exploited in individual cases. A trend, indicative of enhancing the beneficial effects of baclofen, was noted when stretching exercises were added to the treatment. The present study underscores that neither baclofen nor tizanidine are ideal antispastic drugs, and emphasize the need for further research. It is concluded that dantrolene sodium is an effective antispastic drug in about one-third of patients who suffer from spasticity of varying etiology. This is the first demonstration of the beneficial effect of botulinum toxin on focal spastic muscle contractions. Careful monitoring of the patient is essential for effective use of this drug. The well-known "big 3"--dantrolene sodium, baclofen, and diazepam--produce large and small problems in many individual cases; hence, ketazolam now offers a safe and clinically useful alternative."
362,CD003764,"This difference was significant. Three different antibiotics regimes were compared, with no difference in the infection rate: therefore the simplest and surest method, a single pre-operative dose and a single post-operative dose, is recommended. This data indicates that vigorous irrigation and debridement is adequate primary treatment for open phalangeal fractures in fingers with intact digital arteries. No significant infection prophylaxis was demonstrated by the use of intravenous antibiotics in these injuries. Superficial thromboplebitis following the antibiotic infusion occurred in 16 per cent of the dicloxacillin treated patients and in 1 per cent of those treated with benzyl penicillin or placebo."

The clinical significance of this effect needs to be evaluated in further studies. There are no short or long term clinical benefits from the administration of nebulised corticosteroids in the acute phase of RSV bronchiolitis. 2009 Massachusetts Medical Society The administration of salbutamol plus dexamethasone is more effective in the control of respiratory distress in children with bronchiolitis compared with the use of salbutamol alone. Outpatients with moderate-to-severe acute bronchiolitis derive significant clinical and hospitalization benefit from oral dexamethasone treatment in the initial 4 hours of therapy. Copyright 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society.

However, effects of EPI + DEX combination was not different from SAL + DEX combination. Copyright 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Infants with moderate-severe bronchiolitis who were treated with a single dose of dexamethasone did not significantly alter the rate of hospitalisation or respiratory status. We conclude that a 3-day course of oral corticosteroids is of no benefit to infants with mild to moderate bronchiolitis who are also treated with an inhaled beta2-agonist. This study did not demonstrate that a 6-week course of nebulized budesonide reduced the symptoms of acute bronchiolitis or prevented postbronchiolitic wheezing. Oral dexamethasone therapy does not affect the clinical course of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and therefore cannot be recommended in this clinical situation.

364,CD000255,"Patients should undergo a follow-up Duplex scan to identify contralateral ICAD. Copyright 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel A trial of medical therapy (to prevent embolic symptoms) and repeat arteriography are indicated before the consideration of surgical therapy. Copyright 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel. Surgical indications should remain exceptional. TCD data may thus improve the understanding of pathogenetics as well as rationales for individual therapeutic intervention in this particular disease. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel Within the limitations of a nonrandomized study, our data suggest that frequency of new cerebral and retinal ischemic events in patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid artery is low and probably independent of the type of antithrombotic treatment (aspirin or anticoagulants). Spontaneous dissection is more common than the literature indicates. Ischemic events seem rarely to be in relation with chronic arterial lesions. The risks and possible benefits, as well as timing, of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy for BCI should be carefully weighed by the major care providers of the patient with multiple injuries. Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imagery are helpful in diagnosis and follow-up. The analysis of clinical and neuroimaging data from patients with SDCVA allows a better understanding of the disease, leading to an earlier diagnosis and more appropriate treatment. A medical initial approach to the management of extracranial CCAD is recommended for most patients. Patients with dissection-related cervical artery occlusion had a significantly increased risk of suffering a disabling stroke. A multicenter, randomized trial involving antiplatelet therapy, full systemic anticoagulation, or observation with a long-term functional assessment is indicated to determine the optimal management of these injuries. The outcome in our seven cases supports recent trends toward a strategy of early anticoagulation and selective surgical treatment. Disruption of perivascular afferents may be involved in improvement of PH patterns after SCAD. Prompt diagnosis and adequate heparinization with simultaneous start of oral anticoagulation seem to give the best final result. Seven received anticoagulant therapy, stopping any further neurological symptoms. Other mechanisms like direct cervical shock may certainly be found, but we did not observe any instance in this review. As the hematoma is the source of the intracranial emboli, the therapy of choice in this rarely diagnosed disease should be anticoagulation. Treatment with anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid seems recommendable, though scientifically unproven. Ischemic optic neuropathy may occur as an early sign of carotid dissection: young age, previous transient monocular blindness, an association with pain, Horner syndrome, or hemispheric transient ischemic attacks are suggestive of this cause and should prompt confirmatory investigations. Many questions remain to be answered regarding the optimal management of this condition, but treatment should be individualized based on clinical status, computed tomography, and angiographic findings. Contrary to current opinions, ICA dissection with occlusion causing cerebral infarction may often carry a severe prognosis. A delay in the initiation of heparin therapy, no therapy, or the institution of antiplatelet therapy may all be appropriate in the initial management of mural injuries of the internal carotid artery. Occlusion of the dissected artery, ICAD, and infection appear to be associated with poorer outcome. In select patients, early surgical intervention may lessen attending neurologic sequelae. The need for diagnostic angiography is emphasized."
365,CD006101,"We conclude that formoterol is more effective than ipratropium bromide in the treatment of COPD, as the efficacy of ipratropium on airflow obstruction does not translate into a clinical benefit that patients can perceive. These collective data support the use of salmeterol as first-line bronchodilator therapy for the long-term treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. The long duration of action of salmeterol offers the advantage of twice daily dosing compared with the required four times a day dosing with ipratropium. There was added benefit from the combination therapy in terms of improvement in airways obstruction, but not for improvement in symptom control or need for rescue salbutamol."
366,CD004217,"SBP and DBP differed significantly between groups during two of the noninvasive steps; and tcpO2 differed significantly during six steps. Sucrose on a pacifier is an inexpensive and effective method for pain relief in neonatal circumcision when DPNB is not desirable. There were no major complications in any of the groups. The unanesthetized subjects displayed stress reactions that have implications for nursing care. These findings reinforce the reciprocal, synchronous nature of mother-infant interactions during the early postpartum period and the need for pain control after circumcision to promote neonatal comfort and improve mother-infant interaction. EMLA cream may provide pain reduction compared with no anesthesia during neonatal circumcision. Thus, EMLA may be a useful agent for pain management in neonatal circumcision. It is our recommendation that an anesthetic should be administered to newborns prior to undergoing circumcision. We also recommend that infants be given a sweetened pacifier before, during, and after circumcision if the Gomco method is used. Although both types of anesthesia attenuated the physiologic responses to circumcision, local anesthesia demonstrated greater efficacy than dorsal penile nerve block while being simpler to perform. The two interventions were unable to offset the effects of circumcision pain. Ring block is an effective method of anesthesia for this procedure. The use of DPNB significantly reduced objective measurements of pain and physiologic stress in infants undergoing circumcision. Both topical anesthetics were more effective than placebo in attenuating the behavioral and physiologic indicators of neonatal pain. There were no local or systemic complications. Adding a buffering agent to lidocaine did not provide a more effective level of anesthesia in a short time. If circumcisions are to be performed, they should be done as humanely as possible. These data support the use of DPNB during anesthesia for routine neonatal circumcisions still requested by the majority of parents in the country. Physicians who circumcise newborns have good reason to employ the technique of dorsal penile nerve block with lidocaine to minimize infant pain and distress. Cortical input or secondary epinephrine elevation may be producing the cortisol elevation in infants despite regional blockage of the afferent nerve pathways. Topical application of a 30% lidocaine cream as used in this study may be a safe and efficacious anesthetic for circumcision. Inasmuch as dorsal penile nerve block has a low complication rate, is simple to learn, and adds little time or expense to the overall procedure, and if it proves to be as effective clinically as the physiologic data indicate, the dorsal penile nerve block should be considered for every infant undergoing circumcision. This more rapid onset of regional anesthesia decreases DPNB circumcision time and benefits patients, parents, and physicians. Lidocaine-prilocaine cream is efficacious and safe for the prevention of pain from circumcision in neonates. This study demonstrates that, when used in conjunction with DPNB, a pacifier dipped in 24% sucrose and a more comfortable, padded, and physiologic restraint can be useful in decreasing distress and pain. These findings, which parallel results obtained in studies of pain in infant rats, provide a potent yet simple, benign intervention to help alleviate stress and pain routinely experienced by human infants. Dorsal penile nerve block with lidocaine is a more efficacious means of providing anesthesia for neonatal circumcision than the mixture of local anesthetics. The Mogen clamp with DPNB causes the least discomfort during neonatal circumcision. Dorsal penile nerve block is safe and effective in controlling pain associated with circumcision in low-birth-weight infants. Neonates deserve interventions that will provide them with a less painful start in life. Pain during neonatal circumcision can be optimally ameliorated by combined use of a sucrose-dipped pacifier and a local analgesic cream. Results showed that topical lidocaine, simple and safe to use, reduced parameters associated with pain and stress. Acetaminophen was not found to ameliorate either the intraoperative or the immediate postoperative pain of circumcision, although it seems that it may provide some benefit after the immediate postoperative period."
367,CD001069,"Sucrose on a pacifier is an inexpensive and effective method for pain relief in neonatal circumcision when DPNB is not desirable. Further studies are needed. Although the analgesic effect of 12.5% sucrose is slightly superior, hindmilk may be considered as a physiologically suitable alternative to sucrose. It was ineffective when administered intragastrically. It is concluded that sucrose has analgesic effects in healthy premature infants. It is concluded that this sweet-tasting solution has analgesic effects as potent as those of concentrated sucrose solutions. Furthermore, the findings indicate that factors calming the newborn and creating low NIPS scores before the procedure can reduce the pain reaction equivalently and additively to sucrose administration. The duration of crying in response to sampling did not differ in the two groups but was related to level of arousal at the time of stimulation. Single-dose lingual 24% sucrose is effective in reducing the behavioural and physiological pain response to nasogastric tube insertion in preterm infants and it appears to be safe. The synergistic effect of the combination of sucrose and non-nutritive sucking was clinically effective and safe in relieving the pain of simple procedures such as venipuncture or heel stick in preterm and term infants, but further research is needed on these interventions alone and in combination with other behavioral interventions in neonates. A calm or sleeping state before a painful procedure also appears to decrease crying and pain scores. Cerebral blood volume decreased in 5 of 14 infants after sucrose and in 6 of 14 infants after placebo (difference not significant). Research on the effects of gestational age on the efficacy and safety of repeated doses of sucrose is required. No synergistic effect of sucrose and pacifier was apparent in this group. However, pain scores remained consistently high and appropriate pain relief for ROP screening remains a challenge. We also recommend that infants be given a sweetened pacifier before, during, and after circumcision if the Gomco method is used. The routine use of comfort care to reduce pain during the examination could not be supported by this study. Older infants did not show an improved pain response with oral sucrose. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. There was no evidence of harm from liposomal lidocaine or sucrose. These simple and safe interventions should be widely used for minor procedures in neonates. Although oral sucrose may have an additive analgesic effect, it is not necessarily required if VP is used for blood sampling. These findings are of potential clinical significance: natural protective mechanisms, normally engaged during suckling, may safely and noninvasively be activated to reduce newborn crying to painful stimulation. Grimacing was reduced to almost naught by procedures that essentially eliminated crying and markedly reduced heart rate during the blood harvesting procedure. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. The efficacy of sucrose was maintained for pain relief in preterm neonates with no side effects. The increase from before to during heel prick in skin conductance (number and amplitude of the waves) and heart rate correlated with the crying time (p < 0.01). This simple strategy can be promoted in institutions caring for sick babies, as a method of reducing behavioural responses to procedural pain. In addition, research is needed on the influence of implementing these interventions on pain response and clinical outcomes (e.g., health status and neurodevelopmental status) in VLBW neonates in the NICU. This study shows that the association of non nutritive pacifier sucking with oral administration of saccharose and local application of Emla has a better analgesic effect than each of these three interventions alone for subcutaneous injection of EPO. Oral sucrose may reduce the immediate pain response in premature infants undergoing eye examination for ROP. These findings add to the growing literature showing that sucrose attenuates newborns' negative response to aversive or noxious stimuli. This study suggests that breastfeeding provides superior analgesia for heel lance compared with oral sucrose in term neonates. Sucrose and a pacifier may be beneficial for minimizing pain during eye examinations in preterm infants and should be considered as a part of evidence-based guidelines for relieving pain during this procedure. This study demonstrates that, when used in conjunction with DPNB, a pacifier dipped in 24% sucrose and a more comfortable, padded, and physiologic restraint can be useful in decreasing distress and pain. Further study is needed of the possible analgesic effects of sucrose. 2, p < 0.05). Copyright 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel ). Pain relief was best achieved by combining a pacifier with 30% sucrose. Physiological measurements were recorded at different time points to evaluate excessive basal and procedural distress. The results suggest that providing a caregiving context when painful procedures are performed may be a simple and practical method of reducing pain experience in infants, and that no one measure captures these effects. Further research is needed on the use of sucrose for more than one procedure as well as examining the contact component of natural rocking, as opposed to simulated rocking. A proper nursing method, along with a complement of non-nutritive sucking during extraction, significantly decreases the discomfort and crying, it being unnecessary to consider other analgesics. Sucrose may be a useful and safe analgesic for minor procedures in neonates. The orosensorial antinociceptive effect of human milk is not as effective as an analgesic as a 25% sucrose solution. As glucose solutions are readily available in neonatal intensive care units and easier to use in routine practice, further trials are needed to evaluate the antinociceptive effect of glucose when combined with other nonpharmacologic methods. Additional study is needed to determine the most appropriate age and duration of sucrose analgesia in preterm infants. Alternative strategies should be considered to achieve adequate pain relief. Offering a sugar coated pacifier during heelstick in healthy neonates reduces pain behaviors more effectively than a water-moistened pacifier, 2 cc of a 12% sucrose solution, or no intervention. Further exploration of consistent pain management with sucrose on clinical, developmental, and neurobiological outcomes is required. Copyright © 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."

373,CD003838,"Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be superior to diuretics as first-choice therapy in symptomatic mild heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition alone is not sufficient treatment for patients with mild heart failure and a history of overt pulmonary oedema. It was concluded that old people receiving long-term diuretic therapy without obvious current indication should have the drugs withdrawn under careful supervision so that those needing them could be identified. The higher dose of frusemide also had a more favourable effect on visual analogue scores for dyspnoea, fatigue, and general well-being. This approach with captopril also appears to be more physiological and safe. The study suggests that oral piretanide is a relatively safe and effective diuretic for treating congestive heart failure with a potential advantage of having potassium-sparing properties.

375,CD001112,"These findings have diagnostic and therapeutic implications regarding the use of caffeine prior to tests of pulmonary function and as a dietary agent, alone or in combination with theophylline. These data suggest that only high doses of caffeine significantly prevent a postexercise drop in FEV1. Peak caffeine concentration of 8.7 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml occurred at 1 h. The data indicate that caffeine at a dose of 5 mg/kg can produce significant percentage improvement in FEV1, FEF25-75, and Vmax25 in adult asthmatics. We conclude that caffeinated foods and beverages are unlikely to acutely influence FENO in subjects with asthma, and protocols for laboratory measurement do not need to take this factor into account. It thus appears that dietary caffeine is barely a cause of erroneous interpretations of bronchoprovocation challenges with carbachol. Specific instructions about not having drinks containing caffeine before histamine challenge are therefore not necessary. Caffeine should be eliminated from diet prior to BPC."

378,CD008216,"It appears that this new multifaceted treatment offers good palliation, which may prolong survival and a possible cure. The pharmacokinetics suggest that modification of the treatment schedule may result in a reduction of treatment-related toxicity. These observations suggest that a tandem high-dose ICE regimen with autologous PBSCT is feasible with some clinical efficacy in the control of refractory STS. We conclude that high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation may be of use as treatment for inoperable residual disease after resection of the primary lesion in gastrointestinal and other soft tissue sarcomas. High-dose chemotherapy did not seem to change the results in desmoplastic small round-cell tumour.

He died four years later due to a ventricular arrhythmia. To gain additional insight on DSRCT with ovarian involvement, the literature was reviewed and summarized. With spindle cell sarcomas, the efficacy of this treatment was temporary, so it will be necessary to investigate frequent high-dose chemotherapy and to change the high-dose chemotherapy regimen. For control of DSRCT, our experience supports intensive use of HD-CAV, aggressive surgery to resect visible disease, radiotherapy to high-risk sites, and myeloablative chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue in selected cases. Copyright 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel This case report suggests a role for autologous stem cell transplantation as part of multimodality therapy for this unusual and aggressive malignancy. The next step in these particularly poor prognosis metastatic MMT will be to investigate HDT combined with other drugs, known to be efficient at high doses. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of tandem HDCT in patients with high-risk or metastatic/recurrent sarcoma, with some patients achieving long-term PFS and OS. In order for this approach to have a more significant impact on overall survival, it may need to be applied earlier in the natural history of the malignancy.

Karger AG, Basel Use of a carboplatin dose based on GFR should optimise effectiveness in patients with good renal function and avoid excessive toxicity where renal function is impaired. Nevertheless, high-dose chemotherapy as a possible consolidation strategy remains highly investigational. With the common use of neuroleptic and other related psychotropic medications in the peri-transplant period and the associated physiologic stress of the procedure, we believe that NMS may be unrecognized and account for significant morbidity in this setting. Favorable results for disease control, manageable toxicity, and the antitumor profiles of topotecan, thiotepa, and carboplatin, support use of this three-drug regimen in the treatment of neuroblastoma and brain tumors; applicability to other tumors is still uncertain. These results suggest that there are active HDC schedules on metastatic sarcomas, but its possible benefit would be limited to the consolidation of a CR obtained with previous CT. HDC is a therapeutical alternative under investigation in patients with metastatic sarcomas with an indication that could be extended to cover localized sarcomas with poor prognosis. In each case, when considering this diagnosis on the morphologic grounds an attempt to analyze the translocation using PCR should be made, including the recognition of its uncommon variants. Despite all therapeutic modalities the outcome is dismal and surgical efforts can be considered only as palliative. Tumor regression has been noted during multiagent chemotherapy, but prolonged survival is rare with current therapies. Single or double HDT with autologous PBSCT after each cycle is feasible in children and offers basic data for conducting phase III paediatric clinical studies. One alternative involves immunologic attack against markers derived from tumor-specific chromosomal defects such as those found in our patient. These data indicate that (1) patients achieving a CR or PR following induction, with preserved performance status and R (0) resection may benefit from ASCT and (2) that this can be an useful therapeutic modality in a subset of patients, in some achieving remarkable responses.

Single dose therapy should be considered as the treatment of choice for covert bacteriuria in pregnancy. ISRCTN, isrctn.org, ISRCTN11966080 I. It is concluded that a single dose of 3 g amoxycillin is a safe, effective and acceptable treatment for bacteriuria in pregnancy and the puerperium. A single dose of fosfomycin trometamol is a safe and effective alternative in the treatment of asymptomatic urinary tract infections in the second trimester of pregnancy.

Single-dose treatment is not inferior to conventional therapy; future study is needed to find the best single-dose regimen. Our results suggest that for the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy a single dose of 3 g of amoxicillin is equally effective and acceptable as a 4-day course with the advantage of a lower total-dose, lower costs and a better compliance.

382,CD003543,"We are now continuing our program and also trying to modify so that it will be useful to all departments in the hospital. The intervention led to improved quality of surgical prophylaxis and to reduced antibiotic use and costs without impairment of patient outcome. Reduction in the institutional use of fluoroquinolones may be associated with a lower nosocomial MRSA infection rate. A regimen avoiding amoxicillin and cefotaxime restricts the resistance problem. This model could be applied to other antibiotics or other drug classes with good oral bioavailability. Such an approach led to significantly lower antimicrobial therapy costs, antimicrobial resistance, and superinfections without adversely affecting the length of stay or mortality. In our hospital, the value of the data far exceeded the cost of processing and analysis. Uncertainty about the cost effectiveness of such interventions is likely to be resolved only by a well-designed, cluster randomised trial. It can also lead to a return in clindamycin susceptibility among isolates and can effect cost savings to the hospital. This was possibly attributable to high pre-intervention compliance and the limited impact of the strategy on factors outside the perceived control of clinical staff. The majority of prescribers (87.2%) who responded to the questionnaire (56.5% response rate) felt that the 1989 policy made a positive contribution to antibiotic usage in the hospital. These aspects must be studied in greater detail to determine the benefits, if any, that may be derived from such surveillance and control, especially in view of recent proposals for implementation of "peer review" in this as well as other areas. Targeted one-on-one education is a practical, effective, and safe method for reducing excessive broad-spectrum antibiotic use. A multidisciplinary antimicrobial therapy team can be a useful information source for physicians, improve outcomes in hospitalized patients receiving intravenous antimicrobials, and result in substantial cost savings. This multidisciplinary consultative approach thus reduced antibiotic costs, contributed to infection control, and improved the quality of antibiotic prescription. On the basis of a reduced length of stay, a potential cost savings of $1311 per patient can be achieved. The results of this study indicate the rapid same-day bacterial identification and susceptibility testing in the microbiology laboratory can have a major impact on the care and outcome of hospitalized patients with infection. The six-month delay in the decline of CDAD after virtual withdrawal of cephalosporins may reflect a slowly diminishing environmental reservoir. An example is given in the estimation of the cost savings attributable to an improved antibiotic prescribing policy at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. This educational program, although labor-intensive, preserved house staff decision-making skills related to antibiotic prescribing at the same time that it decreased inappropriate vancomycin use. These data indicate that rotation of parenteral antibiotics according to the applied protocol has no detectable effect in decreasing the reservoir of resistant Gram-negative bacilli in a tertiary-care NICU. Outbreaks of C. difficile diarrhoea should be managed with the combined approach of infection control and strict antibiotic policies. Overall, the two-stage intervention was a well-accepted and effective means of cost containment, resulting in an estimated yearly cost savings of $28,000. Improved clinical outcomes were associated with pneumonia guideline utilization. A nosocomial epidemic of C. difficile diarrhea was controlled by analysis of antibiotic use patterns and by subsequent restriction of clindamycin. In this study, practice changes focused towards specific ICUs were associated with decreases in ICU vancomycin use and VRE prevalence. Written- or oral-alert reports with clinical advice should complement traditional microbiological reports for patients with BSIs. Implementation of a pneumonia practice guideline in the Intermountain Health Care system was associated with a reduction in 30-day mortality among elderly patients with pneumonia. These results suggest that an ongoing multidisciplinary antibiotic management program may have a sustained beneficial impact on both expenditures for antibiotics and the incidence of nosocomial infection by C. difficile and resistant bacterial pathogens. These cost savings, coupled with changes in therapy made for reasons of efficacy, support the usefulness of the earlier reporting of the identity and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacterial blood culture isolates. Ceftazidime restriction and barrier precautions for colonized and infected patients are effective control measures. A retrospective analysis of 322 patients with bacteremia treated before and after the onset of the controls revealed that antibiotics were more appropriately used afterwards. These results have shown that the measures adopted were effective. Simple quality improvement methods can be used to optimize obstetric services and improve outcomes of care in resource-limited settings. This combination of clinical and administrative strategies reduced expenditures for antimicrobial agents by more than $700,000 over two years without the use of clinical specialists or any apparent sacrifice in the quality of patient care. A ceiling effect may have limited the added value of AD. This mix is essential in improving patient care and quantifying outcomes. This diagnostic strategy seemed to be safe. We conclude that inappropriate prescribing behaviour in hospitals can be modified successfully by educational marketing techniques. The financial benefits available with use of the guidelines will be limited unless the guidelines contribute to a reduction in rates of hospitalization. The system did not work with ceftazidime which was commonly used for febrile neutropenia and nosocomial infections. These findings suggest that shorter courses of empiric antibiotic therapy for patients treated for clinically suspected VAP can be safely achieved. In view of the current overuse of antimicrobial therapy in often self-limiting acute respiratory tract infections, treatment based on procalcitonin measurement could have important clinical and financial implications. These findings may have important clinical and public health implications. This computer-assisted system of antimicrobial monitoring was used effectively to assess both individual patient therapy and overall antimicrobial use in a teaching hospital. Formulary deletion, countersignature requirements, or restricted use to a service or physician are action plans that may alter the use rates of drugs. We conclude that in a period of increasing constraints on hospital budgets and proliferating restrictions on physicians' clinical choices, educational intervention at the time orders are written can provide a cost-effective and noncoercive means of improving some forms of acute-care clinical decision making. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of quality improvement activities in very small hospitals. Changing physician and organizational behavior in academic health centers will require the development and implementation of more intensive, system-oriented strategies. Clinical pharmacists were effective in reducing the use of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin in situations where cefazolin or carbenicillin could be substituted. The removal of an antimicrobial restriction policy resulted in increased use of and higher expenditures for previously restricted agents, as well as an increase in the inappropriate use of at least one agent. This study demonstrates that a multidisciplinary antimicrobial use program in a Canadian hospital can effect dramatic cost savings and serve as a quality assurance activity of physician antimicrobial prescribing behaviour. Removing these barriers could increase the pharmacists' utility as an agent for improved patient care. TREAT improved the rate of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment while reducing antibiotic costs and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. The association between clindamycin use and the prevalence of VRE suggests that restriction of this and perhaps other antianaerobic agents might be an important component of future antimicrobial interventions. IDS prescribed more restricted (and expensive) agents, but preferred less expensive agents among unrestricted drugs, thereby offsetting the overall medication costs. Annualized savings was $74,371, with 40% of the recommendations resulting in an improved antimicrobial therapy. For the overall patient group in our hospital setting, however, this had no clinical impact. Further work is needed to define cost effective methods to enhance the uptake of evidence from systematic reviews and to clarify leadership and roles of senior obstetric staff in implementing the evidence. Pharmacy-led introduction of antibiotic guidelines appears to result in clinically appropriate reductions in IV therapy. It has potential for linking to electronic prescribing and for wider use for other drugs, as well as for research into the epidemiology of antibiotic use. These data indicate that antibiotic restriction policies in an ICU fail to diminish the size of the endemic reservoir of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative rods, and suggest that such policies in the absence of broader efforts to limit antibiotic use will have little impact. Guidelines for rational antibiotic policy and multidisciplinary co-operation lead to reduction in the use and expenses of antibiotics in a paediatric department. Although the reduction in the risk of acquiring GRE may have been due in part to hygiene practices as well as to the change in antimicrobial usage, or may have occurred spontaneously for other reasons, the return of the problem with the reintroduction of ceftazidime strongly suggests that this antibiotic was responsible for encouraging the acquisition of detectable GRE. ICF can be used safely to curb irrational overuse of vancomycin and teicoplanin in a hospital with high methicillin resistant S. aureus infection rates. Implementation of real-time PCR for the etiological diagnosis of LRTI increased the diagnostic yield considerably, but it did not reduce antibiotic use or costs. We demonstrate that 50% of patients initially treated with expensive parenteral antibiotics can have their regimens refined after 3 days of therapy and that these modifications result in good clinical outcomes with a substantial reduction in antibiotic expense. Manpower requirements to implement and maintain this program were minimal and prescriber antagonism was not encountered. Use of vancomycin decreased after a pharmacy-enforced restriction program was implemented. The multifaceted guideline implementation strategy resulted in a slight reduction in the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and a nonsignificant reduction in length of stay, without affecting patient outcomes. Lasting improvements in clinical practices may be brought about by means that are noncoercive, inexpensive and well-accepted by medical staff. The results suggest that a short questionnaire, easily adaptable to automatization, has the potential to foster reassessment of antibiotic therapy. We conclude that a structured antibiotic order form, coupled with graphic and educational interventions can improve antibiotic use in a university hospital. Despite predominant amikacin use for a total of 38 months, amikacin resistance did not increase and actually decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) in the last 12 months. In contrast, cephalosporin use in the medical and surgical intensive care units remains significantly higher than in the TBICU, and neither unit has had a reduction in their VRE infection rates. The use of an automatic reminder system in the operating room improved compliance with guidelines on perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. It also highlights the need for epidemiologic surveillance, and poses the question of how best to modify antibiotic policy. Institutions considering such programs or with one in place should conduct similar evaluations. This quasi experimental study confirms the association between fluoroquinolone use and MRSA isolation among hospitalized patients. However, close surveillance is needed to detect the emergence of other resistant pathogens. Computerized guidelines represent a promising tool for changing prescribing practices. In the years since, the incidence has remained at this low level, and the antibiotic costs have decreased to a level lower than before intervention."

390,CD000259,"There were improvements in the care of patients of both groups of practices and further studies are indicated to determine the impact of both systematically developed criteria and reminders embedded into restructured medical records. This provided a foundation for improvement and the process thus instigated resulted in the doctors providing better quality patient care. The third group of residents served as a concurrent control, and data on the testing patterns of residents at the same hospital during the year before the study provided a retrospective control. Behavior changes persisted at 6 and 12 months after intervention. Change after mutual practice visits and feedback by peers is more marked than after a visit and feedback by a non-physician observer. Physician interventions that included practice-level feedback about monitoring of glycemic control successfully led to improved care of diabetic Medicare beneficiaries. These results demonstrate that Network feedback, coupled with the intensive intervention, resulted in improvement in care that would otherwise not have occurred. At a time of heightened national attention toward measures of antimicrobial prophylaxis performance, the trial did not demonstrate a benefit of participation in a quality improvement collaborative over performance feedback for improvement of these measures. Future researchers should consider providing point-of-care decision support with redesign of office systems and/or incentives to increase appropriate actions in response to decision-support information. A multicomponent implementation strategy consisting of feedback, benchmarking, academic detailing, facilitation, and IT support increased implementation of evidence-based processes for delivering preventive services to a greater extent than performance feedback and benchmarking alone. Both strategies are feasible within most laboratory settings. Use of a registry-generated audit, feedback, and patient reminder intervention in a resident continuity clinic modestly improved diabetes care processes, but did not influence intermediate clinical outcomes. A need exists for further studies to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of more intensive report card interventions. Unimproved tasks were associated with the perceived need for delivery system changes beyond the immediate control of the individual practitioner. The dissemination of guidelines in the format of prioritized review criteria does not increase adherence to recommendations in comparison with the traditional guideline format, and the further provision of feedback has minimal additional effect. http://clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00187460. Intensive data-based feedback using report cards may not be a successful way to improve ambulatory performance of medical house officers. Among the methods examined, faculty chart review seems to be the most effective method of reducing the amount of laboratory testing performed by house staff. Additional organizational change and/or patient activation strategies may improve plan-wide testing, particularly among asymptomatic women. Audit-feedback systems to improve quality of care are feasible and effective also in hospital settings in low-income countries. This process, composed of collaborative efforts between academic institutions and a managed care organization, may be beneficial to other health care systems. Further research is necessary to evaluate strategies for improving the self-management of asthma patients. The interventions significantly improved the quality of management of oral anticoagulation by Belgian GPs, mainly as a result of an education and support programme. However, it is more difficult to increase use of effective but riskier treatments (eg, thrombolysis) for frail elderly patients. Copyright 1999 American Health Foundation and Academic Press. It appears that only those nursing homes that sought the additional intensive support of the GCNS were able to effect enough change in clinical practice to improve resident outcomes significantly. This was possibly attributable to high pre-intervention compliance and the limited impact of the strategy on factors outside the perceived control of clinical staff. Greater understanding of the underlying processes in improving performance within multidisciplinary teams through further, theory-driven studies with "no intervention" control groups and longer follow-up are needed. Participants identified SPC charts as an effective communication tool and valuable for disseminating WA-MRSA data. Multifaceted interventions appear effective in improving prescribing. Combined physician and patient interventions lowers blood pressure; future research should focus on enhancing effectiveness and sustainability of these interventions. Partnering generalists with diabetes specialists may be important to enhance diabetes management in other primary care settings. Mailed prescriber feedback of detailed and clinically relevant data with a guideline statement, without revealing patient identities, has little or no impact on prescribing patterns. Interventions aimed at improving performance in general practice should go beyond just giving GPs information on whether they are living up to standards. An intervention strategy combining outreach visits, feedback and GP registrations is a promising way of improving the quality of preventive treatment in general practice. Understanding the reasons for this is the key next step in improving the quality of care of patients with coronary heart disease. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The lack of agreement between patient reports and medical records review raises concerns about current methods of ascertaining compliance with guidelines for preventive care. Further work is required to understand dental professionals' behaviour in response to guideline implementation strategies. This study provides Class II evidence that informing hospital leaders of compliance with ischemic stroke quality indicators followed by a structured quality improvement intervention did not significantly improve compliance more than informing hospital leaders of compliance with stroke quality indicators without a quality improvement intervention. Other interventions, such as opinion leaders and patient-directed interventions, may be necessary in order to improve the care of AMI patients. Possible explaining factors may be different attitudes to and experiences with guidelines as well as with continuing medical education programs, and differences in the opportunities for change, including prevailing trends in prescribing behavior. This study design has highlighted the difficulty in balancing the use of evidence-based educational strategies in an equivalent setting to normal practice with evaluation of performance using measures that include characteristics of practitioners' patients that cannot be controlled. Modification of physicians' tetracycline prescribing behavior was achieved in an actual practice setting by personal visits from peer physicians. Clear messages, proper trial design and sensitive outcomes are necessary to demonstrate these changes. Medical audit had no observed effect on AIDS prevention in general practice. Important limitations to the study include variability in data provided by participating GPs and a low number of GPs volunteering for the study. Any department of radiology that handles referrals from primary care could deliver this intervention to good effect. More intensive strategies may be required to change the use of laboratory tests. However, improved methods may be needed to induce a large percentage of physicians to change. There was a general decline in the prescription rate recordings, but there were no significant differences between the intervention groups and the control group. A simple program of confidential feedback and educational materials blunted cost increases, increased the use of first-line antibiotics and was highly acceptable to Ontario primary care physicians. Greater and more sustained improvements may be found if all staff were trained, and trained on a regular basis. We did not find that a program of confidential feedback and educational material offered to Ontario primary care physicians had a clinically significant impact on their benzodiazepine prescribing. Implementation barriers could limit the utility of this approach in usual care settings. Even after extensive CME/QA interventions, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism remained underutilized, suggesting the need to develop new approaches to changing clinical practice. Although there were still significant numbers of patients with uncontrolled hypertension, there is some evidence to suggest that providing patient-specific feedback may have a positive impact on identification and management of hypertension in older people and produce an increase in control. Antibiotic prescribing for viral respiratory infections continues to increase, suggesting concomitant increases in antibiotic resistance. Possible explanations include the context and timing of the intervention, the magnitude of the financial incentives, and lack of physician awareness of the intervention. Financial incentives and feedback did not improve physician compliance with cancer screening guidelines in a Medicaid HMO. The cost of unnecessary tests accounted for 17.6 per cent of the total cost of tests ordered by the residents. Practices where primary care teams received an educational outreach visit demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in uptake in high-risk groups for pneumococcal but not influenza vaccine. The audit intervention allowed to highlight some more subjective criticalities important in determining the success or failure of the implementation of effective practices. To be effective, feedback needs to be integrated in an interactive, educational environment. In this study, a practice-based, multifaceted strategy using guidelines, feedback, and social interaction resulted in modest improvements in test ordering by primary care physicians. Thus, routine feedback can change the quantity and quality of requests. Using resident anesthesiologists, we showed that the written feedback of individualized performance data can be used to lower the overall cost of intraoperative drugs and supplies used for an anesthetic in the absence of mandated clinical guidelines. A multifaceted, physician-led, low-intensity CQI effort can improve the adoption of care processes into national practice within the context of a medical specialty society infrastructure. Because of computerization and ongoing patient and resident randomization at the study hospital, added costs of this randomized trial in terms of computer time and research assistance were less than $1,000. This study suggests that monthly feedback with peer comparison may have a positive relationship with some aspects of quality improvement in cervical screening. But academic detailing did not have an additional effect on changing prescribing over the postal bulletin alone. However, improving processes of care may not always translate into improvement of specific outcomes. Besides, the high cost of deficient quality provides a wide margin to invest with benefits in the promotion of internal QI programmes. Prescribing feedback significantly reduced overall and second-line antibiotic prescribing, but academic detailing was not significantly more effective than postal bulletin in changing antibiotic prescribing practice. New cost-effective modalities are needed to improve the quality of osteoporosis care. Potentially contributing factors include high baseline performance (ceiling effect), dilution of the intervention effect by case mix and provider factors, nonreceipt of intervention materials, and diverse indications for lab tests. A bonus is a powerful incentive, but more structure or education may be necessary to achieve the desired results. This study provides a model for targeting educational input to those prescribers who most need to change their behaviour. The effect is small and the strategy needs further development. Alternative interventions should be explored to improve the pursuit of metabolic control by GPs. Providing comparative feedback on clinician referrals to a quit-line service had a modest impact with limited increased costs. Physician liaisons may play a role in facilitating this change. Future studies with larger sample sizes, lengthier follow-up periods, and interventions that include more of the elements shown to affect practice behavior change are needed to identify an optimal feedback model for use by external quality management organizations. Using composite outcomes may detect meaningful improvements in the management of complex chronic disease. Primary care practices that use electronic medical records and receive regular performance reports can improve their adherence to clinical practice guidelines for cardiovascular disease and stroke prevention. Outreach approaches to assist primary care practices implement office systems are promising but need further development. This conclusion challenges the relevance of feedback on patients' evaluations of care for quality improvement. Feedback appears to be an effective approach to increasing intern cholesterol management in inpatients. The use of opinion leaders improved the quality of care. The interventions had only a small effect on transfusion appropriateness. Data from the electronic patient record were feasible for feedback on prescribing rates. These practices are an efficient route to reaching large numbers of older women in need of mammography screening. These quality assurance audits were effective in improving the performance of selected preventive health measures in a residents' clinic. Use of achievable benchmarks significantly enhances the effectiveness of physician performance feedback in the setting of a multimodal quality improvement intervention. Monitoring of the assessment of acute attacks proved to be a feasible and responsive indicator of quality care. Using medical opinion leaders to intervene in hospitals appeared as effective as performance feedback. However, feedback to pharmacists is promising, especially when including patients' names so that pharmacists can intervene more specifically. Other intervention approaches need to be tested. Wider use of GP-orientated guidelines with regular updating and feedback might save costs and reduce unnecessary irradiation of patients. The form of feedback evaluated here-mailed, unsolicited, centralised, government sponsored, and based on aggregate data-had no impact on the prescribing levels of general practitioners. Among patients with newly detected hypertension test practices achieved a greater reduction in diastolic pressure than control practices (test 15.1 mm Hg v control 11.3 mm Hg) and more sustained control of hypertension (test 323 days per patient-year with a diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or less v control 259 days). The results indicated that the intervention was successful and that pharmacists can play an important role in educating the public about skin cancer prevention strategies. Both the validity and the opinion about feasibility of the guideline in daily practice deserve more attention during guideline development. Similar approaches may aid health care provider behavior and improve diabetes outcomes in other primary care settings. A population-based strategy that monitors performance can significantly improve rates of influenza immunization in private practices. Multifaceted interventions involving audit and feedback combined with either academic detailing or seminars appear more effective in changing prescribing practices of antibiotics than audit and feedback alone. Physician compliance with suggested preventive care protocols can be increased by both delayed feedback and immediate reminders, but reminders have a greater effect. Further testing of this method of influencing physician performance is warranted. Further research incorporating supporting infrastructure, such as physician champions, financial incentives and greater involvement of senior leadership, is needed to assess the value of quality improvement educational programs in rural hospitals. Adequate follow-up during the second year of life is critical in achieving high immunization levels. The results of this study show that linking pertinent published evidence to actual practice data can support the implementation of practice recommendations and influence the selection of dialysis treatment for new patients. Initiatives that have been effective in capitated systems may not be effective in fee-for-service environments. Connecting physician offices to a state-level quitline was feasible and well accepted. The less-expensive intervention was a cost-oriented manual, which may have a "sensitizing" rather than educational effect. There was no evidence, however, that feedback caused hospitals to change their practices in regard to cesarean sections. We conclude that educational programs can improve physician performance substantially and that such programs can be effectively conducted by federally sponsored physician organizations. This study suggests that chart audits may not be the best use of resources for trying to improve physician behavior; credits in continuing medical education and use of structured records may be more likely to be beneficial. Copyright 2002 The Royal College of Radiologists. They also suggest that providing the individual physician with information concurrently on a case-by-case basis may be superior to reviewing audit results for changing physician behavior. The feedback model improved rates of generic prescribing but should be evaluated for broader areas of physician prescribing. The authors conclude that a simple passive educational intervention can be effective at changing group-model HMO physician behavior. More intensive intervention may be required to improve the quality of outpatient care for the secondary prevention of CHD."
391,CD003541,"It is suggested that even brief teaching of relaxation techniques may reduce work stress levels and promote a sense of psychophysiologic health in Chinese nurses who are employed in large teaching hospitals in Taiwan. Results indicate that health-care providers can be taught to employ adaptive coping strategies that improve levels of burnout, but long-term changes are achieved only through long-term coping training. However, the results suggest the need to target this type of intervention to managers who have the personal resources to engage in self-evaluation and personal development and thus to participate in the consultative process. Overall, the results indicate clear support for the effectiveness of assertiveness training for treating subassertive behaviors and stress in a population of professional nurses in Taiwan. The gains made by the inexperienced nurses may have been more associated with increases in their understanding of stress and their feelings of control over stress than with changes in their actual stress management behavior. The results of this pilot study, together with a natural fit between mindfulness philosophy and nursing practice theory, suggest that mindfulness training is a promising method for helping those in the nursing profession manage stress, even when provided in a brief format."

394,CD006616,"NAC treatment even aggravated sepsis-induced organ failure, in particular cardiovascular failure. Our results suggest that the initiation of NAC treatment >24 hrs after hospital admission may potentially be harmful, and further studies should be undertaken to investigate the clinical use of the early application of NAC in critically ill patients. We conclude that N-acetylcysteine infusion does not result in clinically relevant improvements in global VO2, or in clinical markers of tissue hypoxia in patients with severe fulminant hepatic failure. Evaluation of three isoforms of glutathione-S-transferase (GST M1, P1 and T1), in these patients have showed an association between GST M1 null, and GST M1 and T1 double null polymorphisms with increased mortality in control group, suggesting antioxidant therapy critical for this group of patients. In this phase II, randomized, controlled trial, high-dose N-acetylcysteine was no more effective than placebo in attenuating cardiopulmonary bypass-related acute renal failure in high-risk cardiac surgery patients. However, our results do not support the use of NAC in patients with severe sepsis. N-Acetylcysteine decreased pump-induced oxidoinflammatory response during CPB, suggesting that it could be a novel therapy for assisting in the prevention of CBP-induced oxidoinflammatory damage. Whether the N-acetylcysteine challenge was merely diagnostic or whether N-acetylcysteine can be effective in the treatment of sepsis deserves further investigation. The attenuated production of IL-8, a potential mediator of septic lung injury, may have contributed to the lung-protective effects of NAC. This suggests that pretreatment with NAC could be considered to attenuate impaired tissue oxygenation and to preserve myocardial performance better in cardiac risk patients during hyperoxia. There were no significant effects on mortality, morbidity or postoperative graft function. This study failed to show any beneficial effect of the intraoperative administration of NAC on hemodynamics and graft function in liver transplantation in patients with chronic liver disease. Since the release of mediators, especially MPO, is not affected, this diminished activity of elastase may be achieved by enhanced inactivation by antiproteases after initial treatment. Based on these findings NAC appears to act as an oxygen free radical scavenger during open-heart surgery. All rights reserved. Development of ARDS and mortality were not reduced significantly by this therapy. Because of its correlation with liver blood flow index, MEGX may be helpful in identifying patients who benefit from NAC treatment in early septic shock. In conclusion, N-acetylcysteine did not offer any significant protection from renal injury during elective aortic operation in patients with normal preoperative renal function, and some degree of tubular injury seems to occur before aortic crossclamp. In this relatively small group of patients presenting with an established ARDS subsequent to a variety of underlying diseases, intravenous NAC treatment during 72 hours neither improved systemic oxygenation nor reduced the need for ventilatory support. The result of this study indicates that NAC treatment decreases the incidence of postoperative AF. There was no effect in other pulmonary parameters and in terms of intubation time. Our results do not support the routine use of N-acetylcysteine as a prophylactic measure during surgery, and reinforce previous evidence which challenges the indication of N-acetylcysteine in the critically ill. N-acetylcysteine had no renoprotective effect in patients with pre-existing renal failure undergoing cardiac surgery. Such treatment may shorten the duration of acute lung injury, but larger studies are needed to confirm this. Further strategies to decrease reperfusion injury should be devised. Adjunctive therapy with N-acetyl-L-cysteine in newly diagnosed septic shock was associated with a depression in cardiovascular performance, as indicated by progressive reductions in cardiac index, left ventricular stroke work index, and MAP. Treatment with NAC had no effect on outcome in patients with severe falciparum malaria in this setting. This study suggests that the putative beneficial effects of NAC on radiocontrast nephropathy might not be applicable to other situations, such as ARF associated with elective aortic aneurysm repair. Before further clinical studies are started, problems with N-acetylcysteine and coagulation have to be elucidated in order to find out whether N-acetylcysteine could have a beneficial effect in the treatment of ARDS. Reactive oxygen species scavenging with N-acetylcysteine attenuates myocardial oxidative stress in the hearts of patients subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. Results of this study indicated that periprocedural use of NAC as intravenously did not attenuate myocardial damage after on-pump CABG surgery. The trial confirms that NAC and rutin are efficient in protecting the lungs of patients with ARDS. We believe that its effects on clinical outcome may be more apparent in patients prone to ischemia-reperfusion injury. The dose and duration of NAC used, though higher than most renal protection studies, may have been ineffective for raising GSH levels in some patients. Further research is required to identify CABG patients at risk for postoperative renal events, valid markers of renal dysfunction, and to establish renal thresholds associated with important clinical outcomes. Intravenous administration of N-acetylcysteine does not clearly prevent postoperative acute renal failure in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing cardiac surgery. Given this finding, N-acetylcysteine should be definitively evaluated in a large randomized trial. Acetylcysteine is safe and effective in fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose. Further studies are warranted. Patients with advanced coma grades do not benefit from NAC and typically require emergency liver transplantation."
395,CD001943,"Analyses of vital signs and clinical laboratory data revealed no evidence of serious untoward effects. Laboratory tests, urine analysis, cardiovascular and ophthalmological investigations showed no significant abnormalities. The maintenance of therapeutic response after conversion to oral concentrate was comparable with the two drugs. Adverse reactions were also less troublesome with loxapine. Thus a previous finding, based on retrospective analyses, that loxapine was superior to other neuroleptics in the treatment of paranoid schizophrenia was not verified in this prospective study. Loxapine succinate was judged to be an effective treatment for newly admitted schizophrenic patients. On the basis of this study, and in comparison with trifluoperazine, it appears that loxapine is an efficacious and essentially safe medication, suitable for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. One might speculate that the relatively short duration of treatment in this study might account for the difference between these disappointing results and the more gratifying results of a previous loxapine study in chronic long-term institutionalized schizophrenics with the same oral dose. The principal side effects were drowsiness and extrapyramidal signs. Side effects were minimal during the intramuscular phase; dystonia was most common during the oral phase. In conclusion, it was found that loxapine and perphenazine seemed to be equally effective and, based on experience with parenteral loxapine treatment, it is suggested that further investigation of oral loxapine should be carried out in psychotic patients in whom agitation is a feature."

The laparoscopic-vaginal approach for treatment of endometrial cancer is associated with lower perioperative morbidity compared with the conventional abdominal approach. Laparoscopy is a suitable procedure for the treatment of patients with early endometrial cancer and may offer the potential benefits of decreased discomfort with decreased convalescence time without compromising the degree of oncological radicality required; however, it does not seem to modify the disease-free survival and the overall survival, although multicenter randomized trials and long-term follow-up are required to evaluate the overall oncologic outcomes of this procedure. Follow-up of these patients will determine whether surgical technique impacts pattern of recurrence or disease-free survival. Wound infections were more frequent in laparotomies.

401,CD006432,"An arm training programme based on repetition of unilateral and symmetrical bilateral practice did not reduce impairment and disabilities nor improve functional outcomes in the subacute phase after stroke more than the usual therapy. The decrease in speed of these performance-determining variables in the bilateral task warrants consideration during physical therapy intervention for patients with hemiparesis. Nonetheless, on the basis of findings from other studies in which functional improvements occurred in both acute and chronic severely stroke-affected subjects, outcome forecasting for the hemiplegic upper extremity should only eventuate after provision of practice under optimal learning conditions. This impairment in coordination was not due to lateral deviation of the impaired limb. Training with bilateral arm movements may be considered as a treatment strategy, and can be incorporated in stroke rehabilitation to facilitate greater arm active movement and improve motor control performance in the affected arm. These results are discussed in light of the need for further device development and continued clinical trials. These preliminary findings suggest that BATRAC induces reorganization in contralesional motor networks and provide biological plausibility for repetitive bilateral training as a potential therapy for upper extremity rehabilitation in hemiparetic stroke. These findings support the use of BAT to improve motor control and motor function of the affected upper limb in stroke patients. These findings demonstrate that even clinically minor residual motor deficits can be improved by a structured training for the affected arm. Chronic hemiparesis decreased considerably in the wrist and fingers as CVA patients expanded their motor repertoire. In contrast, distributed CIT may produce greater functional gains for the affected UL in subjects with mild to moderate chronic hemiparesis. Overall, these findings indicated improved motor capabilities of the impaired muscles as evidenced by the higher voluntary EMG activation levels. Overall, these findings suggest that a short-term bilateral training intervention may be effective in facilitating upper limb motor function in chronic stroke patients. Intervention timing, task characteristics, dose, and intensity of training may have influenced the results and are therefore areas for future investigation. Bilateral training may be more advantageous for proximal arm function. (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel. Moreover, these intralimb transfer findings extend the evidence favoring motor improvements for coupled bilateral protocols during chronic stroke. Interlimb coupling effects during bilateral reaching are retained even after chronic stroke and can be used to produce an immediate improvement in paretic arm reaching performance."
402,CD002139,"Since three quarters of the patients still die within three years, however, further improvements in systemic and local therapy are needed. A finding of particular interest is that the histological type of the tumour did not influence survival in the 390 patients whose nodes were not involved, although, as expected, it did in the 336 whose nodes were involved, the 226 with epidermoid cancers surviving longer than the 57 with small cell carcinoma, the 31 with adenocarcinoma and all 110 with non-epidermoid carcinomas (P much less than 0.001 in each comparison). Our results suggest that patients with NSCLC at pathologic stage I who have undergone radical surgery benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have inoperable, nonmetastatic disease gain no clinically meaningful survival advantage with immediate thoracic irradiation, even when modern megavoltage radiation therapy techniques and equipment are used. Although the results of the present study are encouraging, clinical research should continue to be directed toward developing more effective treatments for this disease. Chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy as employed in this protocol were of no benefit. Local control was poor in both groups (17% and 15%, respectively) and remained the major problem. Induction chemotherapy produced a better response rate and a trend of improved survival (4 months) but a significant survival advantage was not achieved (p < 0.11), probably because of the small number of patients enrolled in the trial. Toxicity on the chemotherapy arms was significant, with leukopenia of severe or greater degree occurring in 37.8% (CAP) and 40.0% (VP), severe vomiting in 12.2% (CAP) and 23.3% (VP), and severe neurotoxicity in 15.6% (VP). Chemotherapy with MACC, in combination with thoracic radiotherapy, did not result in significant survival advantage compared with radiation alone (P greater than 0.2) in patients with medically inoperable or unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Because of an apparent increase in local response, the combination of VLB and RT merits further investigation in those tumors where local tumor control is crucial. The chemotherapy was not unduly toxic. Whether different chemotherapy regimens may prove more effective in this context should be clarified by further studies. Future investigations of chemotherapy in patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer should continue to utilize control arms which provide high-quality supportive care. High-dose radiotherapy preceded by high-dose chemotherapy was more toxic than radiotherapy alone and did not result in this study in any benefit in terms of response rate, time to progressive disease and overall survival. This study failed to demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of postoperative cisplatin and vindesine chemotherapy. Three long-term survivors were seen in the latter group. No treatment benefit was associated with adjuvant chemotherapy in this trial. Further trials to test adjuvant therapy are indicated, but investigators should use better antiemetics to improve patient compliance as well as more active chemotherapy regimens. It is likely that certain subgroups of the NSCLC category may have an advantage with chemotherapy. Thus, from these results, it is concluded that the role of surgery for non-small cell lung cancer still remains of primary importance, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is effective to improve the results of surgery and prolong life of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. On the contrary, survival beyond the second year of follow-up may have been impaired by the drugs when administered to patients without evidence of tumor spread to the lymph nodes. Further phase III studies of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC should continue to use a no chemotherapy control and should also attempt to measure quality of life, an issue not addressed effectively in this or other recent trials."

405,CD007214,"Good acceptance and satisfaction for the mother should allow a rapid evolution of this new method. It is likely to benefit only those with severe back pain and then only to a modest degree. The application of TENS on specific acupuncture points could be a non-invasive adjunct for pain relief in the first stage of labor. The use of analgesics in each patient was correlated to the duration of labor. Statistical studies of drug requirement during labor, of cervical dilatation duration, of mode and duration of delivery and of analgesia quality showed no beneficial additive effect of electrical stimulation for obstetrical analgesia when extradural anaesthesia is performed. In healthy labouring parturients, the application of a TENS unit did not alter the quality or duration of labour analgesia provided by the spinal portion of CSE analgesia. The evident consumer satisfaction for TENS suggests TENS has a part to play in analgesia in labour but the equivocal findings in terms of factors associated with pain relief points to the need for apparatus more specifically designed to cope with the special characteristics of the pain of labour. In healthy laboring parturients, the application of a TENS unit did not alter the quality or duration of an initiation dose of bupivacaine utilized for the establishment of epidural labor analgesia. The use of this technique in obstetrics is discussed. All newborn infants were in good condition and no significant differences between the two groups could be demonstrated. Intracutaneous sterile water injections are more effective than standard care (back massage, bath, and mobilization) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for relieving low back pain during labor.

406,CD003633,"Botulinum toxin is a safe, effective and relatively simple treatment for spasmodic torticollis. Although individual dose titration and muscle selection is desirable, this study demonstrated that a dose of 500 units of Dysport injected into clinically identified neck muscles without electromyographic guidance is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with the major clinical types of cervical dystonia. The use of larger doses and injection of additional muscles may be necessary to achieve increased efficacy of botulinum toxin in the treatment of torticollis. A high (89%) clinical success rate with BT therapy was obtained, and it is concluded that quantitative EMG is a useful tool for the precise identification of hyperactive muscles, for optimal placing of the injection cannula and for unbiased monitoring of the treatment effect. The main side effect was dysphagia, which appeared to be dose related in individual patients. Botulinum toxin is an effective treatment for toticollis but treatment should be initiated with doses at the lower end of the range used in this study (400-600 mouse units). We conclude that Botox is a valuable treatment for spasmodic torticollis. Thus, botulinum toxin injection is effective in treating cervical dystonias; injection of a higher dose of botulinum toxin in a greater number of neck muscles is required for those patients with complex cervical dystonia."

415,CD009118,"In conclusion, our study demonstrate that lactitol, because of the less number of side effects compared to lactulose, should be considered as an useful agent in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in childhood. It is considered that late response and side-effects in conjunction with poor symptom control influence the patient compliance and the successful treatment of childhood constipation. A fluid fiber mixture and lactulose give comparable results in the treatment of childhood constipation. This 3-month study in 96 constipated children aged 6 months to 3 years confirms the long-term tolerance of PEG 4000 in pediatrics and indicates a PEG efficacy similar to or greater than that of lactulose. Lactulose is recommended as an effective and very well tolerated treatment for the constipated child. Forlax is safe and effective in the treatment of constipation in children over 8 years old. We conclude that balanced lavage solution effectively relieves faecal impaction, however, compliance with its use is poorer than that with mineral oil. Polyethylene glycol was safe for the long-term treatment of these children and was better accepted by the children than milk of magnesia. However, due to its better acceptance, because it is odorless and tasteless, polyethylene glycol proved to be a better option for treating chronic functional constipation. PEG+E is significantly more effective than placebo, and appears to be safe and well tolerated in the treatment of chronic constipation in children. In conclusion in treatment of pediatric functional constipation, regarding clinical efficacy and safety, PEG 3350 were at least as effective as liquid paraffin and but less adverse drug events. It is significantly more effective than lactulose as maintenance therapy, both in efficacy in treating constipation and efficacy in preventing the recurrence of faecal impaction. PEG 3350 should be the laxative of first choice in childhood constipation. Polyethylene glycol 3350 is an effective laxative for the treatment of chronic constipation in children.

417,CD003051,"The application of this novel surgical sealant appears to be effective and safe in preventing postoperative air leaks. This study seems to demonstrate that the surgical application of fibrin glue on the fissural and/or intersegmentary dissection planes is feasible but, as compared to electrocoagulation, does not significantly improve the quality of the surgical results for partial pulmonary excision; however its use could reduce the duration of post-operative drainage. Although this pilot study showed advantages in terms of hospitalization and cost benefits, further multicentric studies are required to clarify that these differences are statistically significant. No adverse drug event related to fibrin glueing was observed. In the subgroup of patients with established air leakage, TC showed superior potential in reduction of intra-operative air leakage as well as in reduction of intensity and duration of postoperative air leakage. Fibrin glue does not add to conventional techniques in reducing moderate to severe alveolar air leak after thoracic operations. Surgical lung sealant may be a useful adjunct to conventional techniques for reducing moderate and severe AAL after lobectomy, but its use seems to increase the risk of postoperative empyema. Vivostat fibrin sealant significantly reduces post-surgical air leakage and drainage volumes following lobectomy in pulmonary surgery and is suitable for routine use in this procedure. The surgical adhesive investigated here demonstrated a compelling safety profile and significant clinical efficacy to stop air leaks after lung resections. We conclude that the routine use of a fixed quantity of fibrin glue is not effective in reducing the duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage, or hospitalization after uncomplicated pulmonary lobectomy. Systematic use of BioGlue may be warranted in adult thoracic surgical procedures (except pneumonectomy and decortication) when an air leak remains after all other steps to control it have failed. Further studies with this and other methods are required to delineate routine versus selective use, to compare methods, and clarify cost benefit. This reduction in air leakage resulted in a significant reduction in both the time to chest drain removal and the period of hospitalisation. Use of the sealant led to a reduction in postoperative air leaks, which may have decreased the length of hospitalization."

It appears that naproxen and naproxen sodium are analgesics with efficacy equal to aspirin and may prove to be rational substitutes for currently available analgesics in some painful states in which longer pain relief would be desireable. Paracetamol was also superior to placebo against the episiotomy pain. These findings suggest that flurbiprofen as an analgesic for patients with postpartum uterine pain is equivalent to aspirin and superior to codeine. These results demonstrate the efficacy of single doses of fendosal as well as the dose-dependent magnitude and time course of effects on postpartum uterine pain. Our results suggest that, for postpartum uterine pain, analgesia with anirolac, 50 or 100 mg, is equivalent to that with naproxen, 550 mg. In their ability to distinguish codeine from placebo, patients with uterine cramp, episiotomy, or surgical pain did not appear to differ. Two new parameters for determining analgetic effect are introduced: number of dropouts per dose and number of subjects with zero analgetic effect. There was no difference between analgesic effects of aspirin and aspirin-caffeine in women with severe uterine pain. Compared to aspirin, ketorolac 10 mg induced equal or more analgesia, whereas ketorolac 5 mg was near the minimum effective dose and seemed less effective than aspirin."

421,CD004735,"The findings of this study may be specific to the population studied, and extrapolation to dissimilar populations may not be warranted. Antepartum hospitalization was decreased by 2.5 days in those women randomized to intentional delivery. Among women with preterm premature rupture of the membranes at 32 to 36 weeks with mature surfactant profiles, immediate induction of labor reduces the duration of hospitalization and infection in both mothers and neonates. Aggressive management of preterm premature rupture of the membranes at > or = 34 weeks 0 days of gestation by induction of labor is safe for the infant in our population and avoids maternal-neonatal infectious complications. We conclude that treatment of women with preterm prematurely ruptured membranes with hydrocortisone and timed delivery offers no advantage over expectant management. Comparisons with one other similar prospective, randomized study support the concept that expectant management offers less risk from tocolytic side effects. The conclusion is that corticosteroids and active management in patients with premature rupture of the membranes and premature gestations do not decrease the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome or perinatal mortality and may aggravate certain infectious complications."
422,CD001266,"Nebulized terbutaline therapy does not appear effective in treating moderately ill infants with the first acute bronchiolitis. A potentiating effect of corticosteroids on the beta-adrenergic responsiveness is a possible explanation for the advantage of this combined treatment in the management of acute wheezing in infancy. Although there appears to be an age-dependent degree of response, metaproterenol is effective in relieving the respiratory distress of young acutely wheezing children, including those with documented respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. Copyright 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel. However, the nebulized bronchodilator treatments were more effective than aminophylline IV in decreasing scores on the first day, and they resulted in shorter hospitalization. Oral salbutamol is not superior to placebo in reducing the duration of symptoms in mild cases of acute bronchiolitis in children. We conclude that nebulized albuterol constitutes a safe and effective treatment of infants with bronchiolitis. The widespread use of oral albuterol in this patient group is not recommended. Based on these results, we do not recommend routine use of either nebulized EPI or ALB in this patient group. In a double blind randomised trial, we found no evidence that nebulised ipratropium bromide was of clinical benefit in acute bronchiolitis. Salbutamol was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc. This study supports the use of nebulized albuterol in the treatment of wheezing infants in the emergency department. 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Nebulized albuterol in infants with mild bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus did not improve VPTEF/VE and tPTEF/tE but did decrease TEF10 and 25/PT. Nebulized albuterol therapy does not appear to enhance recovery or attenuate severity of illness in infants hospitalized with acute, moderate bronchiolitis, as evidenced by improvement in oxygen saturation, time to meet standardized discharge criteria, or length of hospital stay. The use of bronchodilators did not alter the course of the disease and is therefore not effective in the treatment of bronchiolitis. Inhaled bronchodilators did not improve the condition of hospitalised mild bronchiolitis. Routine nebulised aerosol sympathomimetic treatment during acute bronchiolitis cannot be recommended. We conclude that salbutamol is safe and effective for the initial treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis. Thus the benefit of bronchodilator treatment in these patients is small, does not differ among the drugs we studied and of questionable value. It is concluded that there is no role for the nebulized bronchodilators Salbutamol and Ipratropium bromide, either as a single agent or in combination, compared with normal saline placebo in treating young children in hospital with bronchiolitis. This study underscores the importance of these design components in measuring the efficacy of albuterol in infants. We conclude that nebulized albuterol is effective in the treatment of infants with recurrent wheezing, but there was no demonstrable efficacy of orally administered or nebulized albuterol in relieving the respiratory distress of infants with bronchiolitis in Egypt."
423,CD004950,"This study suggests that breastfeeding provides superior analgesia for heel lance compared with oral sucrose in term neonates. Breast feeding effectively reduces response to pain during minor invasive procedure in term neonates. Further studies are needed. Breastfeeding is a potent analgesic intervention in newborns during a standard blood collection. The orosensorial antinociceptive effect of human milk is not as effective as an analgesic as a 25% sucrose solution. This study has confirmed some well known information that breast feeding and oral sucrose solution have pain reducing effects in infants undergoing venipuncture. The combination of oral glucose and breast-feeding shows the lowest pain score and significantly shorter duration of crying. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. In contrast, glycine tends to increase pain reaction whereas breast milk has no effect. Breast milk and 10% glucose did not have a similar effect. A calm or sleeping state before a painful procedure also appears to decrease crying and pain scores. The conclusion was that breastfeeding was effective in reducing pain caused by blood collection for newborn screening. Breastfeeding in the 1st 2 postnatal days with skin-to-skin contact did not increase the analgesic effect of skin-to-skin contact alone. Feeding and breastfeeding during heel-lancing were found to be the most effective methods of pain relief. The implications of this dissociation are discussed. It is concluded that neither foremilk nor hindmilk is superior in relieving pain when compared to placebo. Feeding 5 ml of EBM before venepuncture is effective in reducing symptoms due to pain in term neonates."

Decline of remodeling toward an adynamic state with an increased risk of hypercalcemia appeared prevented. Dihydrotachysterol, the less costly agent, can be used with equal efficacy. Early administration of alfacalcidol can safely and beneficially alter the natural course of renal bone disease in patients with mild to moderate renal failure. Doxercalciferol is safe and effective in controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4. treatment in chronic renal failure does not affect the progressive loss of calcium from bone despite normalisation of plasma-calcium. This observation suggests that the parathyroid is more sensitive to calcitriol than intestine and bone. This may be partly due to suppression of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Long-term treatment with alfacalcidol is safe and might be beneficial for the preservation of bone mass in the pre-dialysis stages of CRF, most likely through a reduction in bone turnover as estimated from the changes of the biochemical bone markers. Our results confirm the good efficacy of multiple calcitriol oral boluses but also suggest for the first time a single weekly bolus as a reliable approach to the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in pre-dialytic renal failure. It is concluded that oral calcitriol pulse therapy does not control secondary hyperparathyroidism more effectively than the daily administration of calcitriol in children with chronic renal failure prior to dialysis. might protect renal function at the expense of abnormalities in mineral metabolism. We conclude that a low dose of calcitriol may be used to preserve or even restore bone metabolism in patients with predialysis chronic renal failure if serum calcium is closely followed and hypercalcemia promptly treated.

431,CD006771,"It was concluded that subcutaneous UH in an APTT-adjusted dose and subcutaneous LMWH in a once-daily weight-adjusted dose controlled these markers of hemostatic system activation in a similar manner. The results of this trial establish the efficacy of intravenous heparin in the treatment of proximal venous thrombosis and suggest a relation between the effectiveness of heparin and the levels of anticoagulation achieved; such a relation could explain the observed failure of the subcutaneous regimen. Two major, non-fatal pulmonary emboli occurred, one in each group. Subcutaneous UFH with dose adjusted by activated partial thromboplastin time by means of a weight-based algorithm is as effective and safe as fixed-dose nadroparin for the initial treatment of patients with VTE, including those with pulmonary embolism and recurrent VTE. It is concluded that subcutaneous fixed dose Fraxiparine is safe and at least as effective as subcutaneous adjusted UFH in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. The results showed that subcutaneous injections of sodium heparin are as effective and safe as continuous intravenous infusion of this drug in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00182403. We conclude that subcutaneous heparin treatment with UH or LH appears safe and convenient. Thromboembolic complications occurred with both methods of treatment when anticoagulation was ineffective. Conclusion: Adjusted subcutaneous calcium heparin may be an effective and safe alternative to continuous intravenous calcium heparin in the initial treatment of acute proximal deep vein thrombosis. However, low molecular weight heparin seemed to be safer than standard heparin. This study showed that subcutaneous calcium heparin was more effective in helping lyse existing thrombus and preventing its propagation than intravenous sodium heparin.

Intensive rehabilitation in this study speeded up recovery rather than changed the final outcome. Probably only a few stroke patients, mostly men, are suitable for intensive outpatient rehabilitation, but for those patients the treatment is effective and realistic. Recommendations about how specialist services should be targeted are made both in the light of these results and those from a previous randomised controlled trial. Longer term follow-up studies are required as psychological sequelae and, therefore, the need for intervention is known to increase with time and may not be most apparent during the first 6 months. This study demonstrates that significant functional gains can still be attained in the postacute stroke survivor, despite prior inpatient rehabilitation services. Further studies should focus on patients with several complaints during the first 1-3 months and test various types of interventions.

The effect of the drug on survival remains to be determined. In conclusion, long-term treatment with pimobendan significantly lowered morbidity and improved the physical activity of patients with mild to moderate CHF. Drugs that improve symptoms in severe end stage heart failure should not be discarded lightly. The mechanism by which the drug exerts its deleterious effects is unknown. Twelve weeks of treatment with low-dose enoximone improves exercise capacity in patients with CHF, without increasing adverse events. The balance between benefit and risk of treatment with this compound remains to be established however. The aetiology and diuretic requirement of patients may influence their response to treatment. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) A short-term benefit in terms of the quality of life raises issues about the appropriate therapeutic goal in treating heart failure. This study failed to demonstrate that imazodan provided any benefit in exercise performance when compared with placebo. However, because recent evidence indicates that the flosequinan dose studied in the present trial has an adverse effect on survival, the benefit-to-risk ratio must be assessed in individual patients. However, a higher dose of vesnarinone (120 mg per day) increased mortality, suggesting that this drug has a narrow therapeutic range; the long-term effects of vesnarinone are unknown.

438,CD001351,"Massage might be an effective alternative to conventional medical care for persistent back pain. The authors found a long-term pain-relieving effect of needle acupuncture compared with true placebo in some patients with chronic nociceptive low back pain. This study provides additional data on the potential role of EA in the treatment of LBP, and indicates that the combination of EA and back exercise might be an effective option in the treatment of pain and disability associated with chronic LBP. In addition, an overall mean for all five measures combined showed significant superiority of acupuncture over placebo. Clinical results show that deep stimulation has a better analgesic effect when compared with superficial stimulation. Standardised acupuncture treatment seems to be safe and effective in the treatment of acute low back pain in general practice. The results suggest that 2 Hz electrical stimulation is the mode of choice when using acupuncture in the treatment of chronic nociceptive low back pain. This trial cannot exclude the possibility that both treatments are 'placebos'. Further research is necessary to fully assess the efficacy of this treatment in combating chronic low back pain using larger sample sizes or alternative control groups. The consistency of the results provides, in spite of several discussed shortcomings of this pilot study, evidence that in patients with chronic spinal pain syndromes spinal manipulation, if not contraindicated, results in greater improvement than acupuncture and medicine. The injected substance apparently is not the critical factor, since direct mechanical stimulus to the trigger-point seems to give symptomatic relief equal to that of treatment with various types of injected medication. The trial demonstrated a placebo effect of traditional acupuncture in chronic LBP. We suggest that more realistic acupuncture interventions based on standard practice should be employed in pragmatic RCTs. For the visual analogue scale measure of average pain, there was a statistical trend at the return visit suggesting that the acupuncture group was experiencing less pain. Acupuncture is an effective, safe adjunctive treatment for chronic LBP in older patients. Furthermore, 58% of the treatment groups felt that they were definitely improved at 40 weeks, while only 11% of the Inadequate Treatment Group felt definitely improved at 40 weeks. None of the variables tested predicted which patients would specifically respond to acupuncture or placebo."
439,CD002122,"The results of this study suggest that gestrinone is as effective as danazol in the treatment of infertility associated with endometriosis and is better tolerated. Factors of importance for quality of life such as sleep disturbances and anxiety-depression improved significantly after treatment with nafarelin or medroxyprogesterone acetate. However, women should be carefully counseled regarding menstrual changes and the potential prolonged delay in the return of ovulation. Luteal phase dydrogesterone reduces pain associated with endometriosis. This study suggests that oral gestrinone 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg twice weekly is efficacious and safe in the treatment of endometriosis. Dienogest 2 mg/day orally demonstrated equivalent efficacy to depot LA at standard dose in relieving the pain associated with endometriosis, although offering advantages in safety and tolerability.

441,CD003420,"The study demonstrates that levothyroxine does not prevent relapse of hyperthyroidism after successful restoration of euthyroid function by antithyroid drugs and characterizes posttreatment TSH as a main prognostic marker. The use of azathioprine may be advised in patients with contraindications to the radical Graves' disease treatment and in prophylaxis of its complications. Moreover after a 3-year follow-up the remission rate of high dose (60.3%) is not different from which is obtained with intermediate one (20 to 30 mg/d) associated with a permanent decrease of TSH by thyroid hormone. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) This study has found that, in Spanish patients, the use of high doses of carbimazole with T4 offers no advantages in the treatment of GD hyperthyroidism. The administration of thyroxine during antithyroid drug treatment decreases both the production of antibodies to TSH receptors and the frequency of recurrence of hyperthyroidism. However, it leads to more frequent side-effects than conventional dose treatment. The administration of T4 to patients with Graves' disease during carbimazole treatment and after its withdrawal neither delays nor prevents the recurrence of hyperthyroidism. We conclude that the addition of T4 to methimazole does not improve long-term remission rates in Graves' disease. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) However, due to the relatively small number of smoking patients in the present cohort, this conclusion needs to be confirmed by a larger study. High TRAb levels and goiter weight at the end of ATD treatment may hint at recurrence. The present study suggests that antithyroid drugs treatment can be terminated more appropriately when both the serum TSH level and TBII activity are made normal, thus avoiding prolonged and unnecessary drug treatment. However, the relapse rates in both groups, and the number of side-effects in the high-dose group, were unacceptably high. Concomitantly, no predictor of recurrence of disease could be identified, irrespective of treatment modality. Only the size of goiter on initiation of treatment may be a prognostic factor for disease evolution. Smoking, large goiter and presence of TRAb at the end of ATD therapy were strong predictors of relapse. These results show that six months treatment with a block-replace regimen of antithyroid drugs is probably sufficient, in the UK, to achieve maximum remission of Graves' disease and that there are no HLA markers which clearly predict outcome. These findings would indicate that, when a defined duration treatment is planned, prolonging treatment beyond 18 months does not provide any additional benefit. This will provide the same chance of remission as higher doses, and provide the best balance of risk and benefit. However, our data suggest that TSH suppressive treatment may have a beneficial effect on thyroid enlargement in Graves' disease. In conclusion, the changes in the measured variables and the progress of the patients was similar whether treated by the HD or TD regimen."

In conclusion, no permanent antiviral effects of rIFN-alpha 2c in chronic delta hepatitis, using this schedule, was achieved. Finally, the presence of serum hepatitis D virus RNA at the end of therapy, detected with nested polymerase chain reaction, might be a good marker for the prediction of viral replication relapse."
443,CD001261,"These results indicate that it will be necessary to identify a vaccine formulation and schedule for Ty21a S. typhi that is practical and provides high level protection for greater than 2 years. The immune responses among vaccine recipients ranged from 60% in 3-year-olds to 81% for 6-year-olds. The results of the follow-up indicate that, in the dosage schedule used, the Ty21a mutant strain, found previously to be stable and safe, is protective against typhoid fever for at least one year. The antibody responses and the efficacy suggest that this vaccine should be at least as protective in persons who are more than five years old. Ty21a may now be regarded as a practical public health tool. Primary and booster immunizations with the Vi vaccines are well tolerated in healthy adults; mean Vi antibody levels remain significantly elevated for up to 34 months after primary immunization. The slightly higher dose of vaccine did not seem to alter efficacy significantly in China. Surveillance continues to determine the duration of Vi-induced immunity. Thus, the liquid formulation of Ty21a is preferable to enteric-coated capsules. We believe Vi vaccine may serve as a vaccine of new generation to be promoted. Vi CPS is thus a safe and effective means of typhoid vaccination. Under conditions of intense transmission, Ty21a protected against typhoid fever; however, because Ty21a will not protect all individuals, there is a need for additional approaches to prevent the disease."

450,CD001831,"This is probably the result of drug action on mucus viscosity, restoring optimal mucociliary clearance, and through action fostering the penetration of antibacterial substances into the mucus. However, the ADC did have significantly greater sedative effects than did placebo. We conclude that there is no clinically significant improvement in symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, including no significant placebo effect, in young children for whom an antihistamine-decongestant is prescribed. The results indicate that codeine, either as a single 30-mg dose or in a total daily dose of 120 mg, is no more effective than the syrup vehicle in controlling cough associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection. Terfenadine was found to be ineffective in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of the common cold. An antitussive combined with a beta 2-sympathomimetic might be the most effective treatment in this type of cough. We conclude that the cough of the common cold arose from upper respiratory tract stimuli and that cough and other cardinal symptoms of the common cold were reduced with antihistamine-decongestant therapy when these symptoms were at their worst. The results also demonstrate that the sound-level meter appears to be a potentially useful investigative tool for the assessment of cough and antitussive efficacy. There were no differences between groups for the frequency of drowsiness. The results confirm the multisymptom benefit of a single dose of the test syrup containing paracetamol, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, doxylamine succinate and ephedrine sulfate and support its role as an effective and convenient therapy for symptoms of nasal congestion, runny nose, cough and pain/body aches associated with the common cold and for increasing sleep quality disturbed by the common cold. The diurnal variation in cough frequency measured by the tape recording was not apparent from the subjective cough frequency estimates obtained by the questionnaire. Each clinician should consider these findings, the potential for adverse effects, and the individual and cumulative costs of the drugs before recommending them to families. These results establish the sensitivity and robustness of the cough quantitation methodology in the objective evaluation of cough treatments. The consistent nature of the results shows that the computerized cough acquisition and analysis system is a valid and reproducible methodology for evaluating cough associated with URTI. This study provides very little if any support for clinically significant antitussive activity of a single 30 mg dose of dextromethorphan in patients with cough associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection."

(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) However, it is essential that blood pressure and hematocrit be carefully monitored, particularly in hypertensive patients, to prevent the development of complications associated with hypertension. Recombinant human erythropoietin is an effective and potent treatment of anemia caused by renal failure. Recombinant human erythropoietin is effective and safe in ameliorating the anemia of pre-dialysis patients. This study concludes that r-HuEPO therapy improves anemia in predialysis patients and does not accelerate the rate of progression to end-stage renal disease. We conclude that erythropoietin therapy is effective in correcting the anemia of patients with progressive renal failure without affecting renal function, although it may be associated with an increase in blood pressure.

455,CD002008,"A three month intervention with high protein oral supplements improves outcome in malnourished patients with digestive disease in terms of functional status, QoL and rehospitalization. Further studies are needed, with larger sample sizes, to investigate the effects of these types of interventions before any further conclusions can be drawn. At discharge patients should increase protein intake to 1.5 g.kg-1.d-1 for 2 mo, e.g., by taking protein-rich liquid supplements. They suggest that diminished whole body protein catabolism resulted in a change of body composition (increased lean mass, decreased fat mass). Copyright 1999 Harcourt Publishers Ltd. Food supplements did not affect treatment response or complications, nor did they offer any survival advantage. Additional investigations are warranted to determine the impact on body composition. Further research is needed to determine the effects of supplements on appetite in patients with advanced cancer. The proposed nutritional approach was able to influence their protein malnutrition positively. There was no significant change in energy intake or percent ideal body weight in either group. Dietary improvement in elderly women with low BMI is associated with a reduction in bone resorption with a small but "net" positive effect on bone formation. Postoperative nutritional supplementation improved nutritional status, QOL, and morbidity in these patients. Nutritional behaviour correlated with subjective well-being, low intake with complaints of tumour treatment side effects and weight loss with malaise. Copyright 2002 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. For colorectal cancer, serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and percent targeted caloric intake (TCI) were significant independent predictors of survival duration. Dietary counseling for a balanced homemade diet is as good as commercial food supplements in improving malnutrition in patients with CP. No difference was observed between the control and adjunctive groups in clinical status at the end of treatment or in long-term outcome. It is suggested that individualized diet counselling, aimed at optimizing the patient's nutritional status, may play a role in the management of patients with Crohn's disease. Frail elderly can gain weight through oral supplementation, indicating the reversibility of weight loss in this group, but changes in functional status indicators may require a longer period of supplementation. IS, including nutritional support, leads to more rapid weight gain than SC in patients with newly diagnosed GI cancer. Combined nutritional intervention prevented weight loss and improved ADL functions in discharged geriatric patients at risk of malnutrition. These findings suggest that the cachexia of cancer may be slowed or reversed through noninvasive nursing interventions. Although further study is needed to evaluate long-term effects, these findings suggest that nutrition counseling has an important role in the management of malnourished HIV-infected patients. No clinical benefit could be demonstrated despite long-term and continuous improved food intake in cancer patients with solid tumors undergoing aggressive chemotherapy. Dietary counselling for increased intake of calories, vitamins and also calcium is thus very important in the treatment of patients with COPD. Copyright 2001 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Dietary counselling and food fortification resulted in weight gain and improvements in outcome in nutritionally at-risk outpatients with COPD, both during and beyond the intervention period. More detailed work of alternative outpatient strategies combined with additional rehabilitative measures is indicated to delineate the full therapeutic potential of nutritional support for this clinical population. This resulted in better maintenance of body weight and somatic protein compartments compared with the control group. This study indicates a beneficial effect of intensive dietary advice in order to improve nutritional status after radiation treatment. Copyright 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. However, balanced nutrient intake can be achieved for patients when supplementation is given postoperatively at a level of 50% of estimated caloric requirements, and can result in improved nitrogen retention and protein sparing. During radiotherapy, both interventions positively influenced outcomes; dietary counseling was of similar or higher benefit, whereas even 3 months after RT, it was the only method to sustain a significant impact on patient outcomes. This oral supplement may be a safe, effective, and cheap method to improve nutritional status in peritoneal dialysis patients. Nutritional intervention after the initial phase of treatment could be less beneficial because it mainly increases fat. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel The results showed the benefit of dietetic treatment in experimental patients with head and neck or abdominopelvic cancer. An isolated nutritional counselling did not result in such an increase. These preliminary observations suggest that dietary and supplementary refeeding may improve the immune responses in patients with COPD.

(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) These results were concordant with the overall clinical assessment made by the specialist in charge. The investigational drug was found to be well tolerated. In this period, about two-thirds of the patients on Ginkgo-biloba, and about one-fifth of the patients on placebo showed improvements. Inter-group differences in the ADAS cognitive and non-cognitive subscales did not reach statistical significance, probably because of the small sample size. Conclusions: Treatment with ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 improves mental/mnestic performance.

462,CD000536,"Our results demonstrate that coumarin treatment does not improve outcome in routine femoro-popliteal and femoro-distal reconstructive surgery. In this randomized trial LMWH was as effective as UFH in preventing thrombosis without excess bleeding or hemorrhagic complications. Perioperative anticoagulation therapy with heparin increases the incidence rate of wound hematomas, but long-term anticoagulation therapy with warfarin improves the patency rate of autogenous vein infrainguinal bypass grafts and the limb salvage rate for patients at high risk for graft failure. Therefore, low molecular weight heparin treatment cannot be recommended for routine use after bypass surgery for critical lower limb ischemia. This treatment should have considerable cost benefits. When heparin is contraindicated ancrod is an effective and safe alternative. High fibrinogen levels could thus be a risk for perioperative thrombosis. Following autologous vein bypass surgery in the treated group, the results were superior in terms of graft patency, limb salvage, and survival. The long-term administration of warfarin therapy when combined with aspirin therapy has only a few selected indications for improvement of bypass patency and is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. dextran 70 and the low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin have the same effect on 90 days femorodistal graft patency, but care must be taken using the dextran to patients with a potential heart insufficiency. Based on additional case histories in these patients with hypercoagulability, it is suggested that fibrinogen is a risk factor for thromboembolic complications and that a combination of low dose of heparin and AT might be an effective regimen to prevent intraoperative thrombosis with a low risk of haemorrhage."
463,CD000146,"Another promising approach would be to combine the inhaler with a nicotine patch. It is concluded NNS is safe, efficacious and a viable alternative treatment for smoking cessation. This is however a post-hoc finding and should be taken with caution. Continuous, structured, and composite efforts are needed for the maintenance of the non-smoking behavior. Short TNS treatment (3 weeks) is at least as effective as a longer one (6 weeks), which is relevant both medically and economically. However, in conjunction with previous pre-cessation trials there appears to be a moderate benefit, but not as large as that seen in most smaller trials. Combination nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches were delivered safely in a nonspecialized outpatient clinical setting and enhanced short-term smoking abstinence rates, but these rates were not sustained at 6 months. Higher-dose (44-mg) nicotine replacement does not appear to be indicated for general clinical populations, although it may provide short-term benefit to some smokers attempting to quit with minimal adjuvant treatment. Until larger trials are completed, however, the possibility that this dose of nicotine gum may produce small beneficial effects cannot be excluded. We concluded that transdermal nicotine, when used as an adjunct to low-intervention therapy, significantly reduced tobacco withdrawal symptoms and enhanced smoking cessation rates. Abstinence rates were higher with combination therapy than with bupropion alone, but the difference was not statistically significant. Duration of counseling, patient age, and Fagerstrom scores may be important factors related to the long-term smoking cessation success of nicotine patch therapy. Ethnicity, weight, and level of nicotine dependence may help identify smokers who have greater or lesser abstinence rates with either transdermal or nasal spray nicotine. We conclude that, when used in a nonselected group of smokers along with a brief intervention in a general medical practice, the pharmacologic effects of nicotine gum to increase cessation are either small or nonexistent. Other mild, transient, systemic side effects reported by 33.9% of the TNS and 26.8% of the placebo users (n. s.) did not lead to drop-outs. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. Cost-benefit estimates suggest that an insurance plan, HMO, etc., would recoup any costs in subsidizing nicotine gum and perhaps incur a net financial gain. National Institutes of Health. In hospital patients NRT, given as regular daily patches plus an inhalator to be used as needed, did not add to the smoking cessation rate achieved at 1 year by regular advice and support, despite significantly increasing the cessation rate at 1 week. Future efforts should focus on increasing adherence to behavioral program components, particularly session attendance. Treatment with the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch resulted in significantly higher cessation rates than inhaler plus placebo patch. These results call into question the utility of cue exposure treatment for smoking relapse prevention. Thus, when nicotine-replacement therapy is provided, a need exists for concurrent behavioral intervention and training for prevention of a relapse, neither of which was part of this protocol. Smokers with lower baseline nicotine and cotinine levels had better cessation rates, which provides indirect evidence that they had more adequate nicotine replacement with this fixed dose of transdermal nicotine than those smokers with higher baseline levels. The results of the study are discussed in terms of strategies that might improve the success of treatment-matching approaches with newer forms of nicotine replacement therapies. The transdermal nicotine patch is effective when used as an adjunct to a group cognitive-behavioural intervention and it provides relief from withdrawal symptoms associated with nicotine dependence. Examination of 132 self-selecting patients who fully participated in the three interventions and attended all scheduled visits, revealed significantly larger proportions of abstainers within Groups SBCN (34%) and SBC (33%) than in Group AN (15%) at the 12-month follow-up. NRT given with brief counselling to hospital inpatients is an effective routine smoking cessation intervention. The results indicate that the transdermal nicotine patch is an effective aid in smoking cessation programs. The present study shows no difference between physician versus nurse counseling and no improvement in the proportion of quitters with the addition of nicotine gum in the physician-counseled group. The rate of success in this group was 25.8%, without statistically significant difference with the first group. However, it did not produce the expected effect on weight, thereby restricting our ability to examine the effect of weight control on smoking cessation and relapse. Treatment of smokers with NI and SA should be restricted to smoking types in which an effect superior to PL is documented, and research should be performed to find support for smoking types where SA and NI have a clear effect. In conclusion, the use of nicotine nasal spray significantly increased the abstinence rate during the first 6 months following the quitting day. The low percentage of participants using the nasal spray at 1 year, and the few relapses during the second year, suggest that it is not cost effective to use a nasal spray for longer than 7 months after stopping a patch. Long-term cessation may require extended maintenance procedures and/or an identification of optimal gum use. Results of this study were consistent with results of larger trials of smokers without alcohol problems, showing that combination therapy (nicotine patch plus gum) is more effective than monotherapy (nicotine patch) for smoking cessation. With a longer active follow-up period than was used here (1 month), even better results may be possible. We compare this result with others achieved in general practice. Nicotine mouth spray delivered significantly higher 6-, 24- and 52-week continuous abstinence rates than placebo. The gum was well accepted by patients and gave no serious side effects. Determination of plasma cotinine values may be, thus, helpful in identifying smokers who could benefit from transdermal nicotine replacement. After a one-year follow-up period, the success rates were in the same order of magnitude for nicotine gum (active treatment: 10%, placebo: 8%) group and for acupuncture (active treatment: 8%, placebo: 10%) group. Nicotine patches had no influence on smoking cessation during pregnancy, although they might increase birth weight in comparison with placebo. Nicotine gum schedule had no effect on treatment outcome. To conclude, the set-up investigated in this study which included minimal behavioural support with nicotine patches should be evaluated in other lung clinics, as it doubled success rate when compared to a placebo with a 1-yr point prevalence of 16% and also the resources used are limited. Efforts should be made to reach underserved populations through smoking cessation programs, and to assist in maintaining abstinence. NRT should be used to aid cessation in all smokers with COPD, regardless of disease severity and number of cigarettes smoked. These findings demonstrate that smokers who wish to quit smoking by gradual reduction can increase their success by using nicotine gum to facilitate reduction and cessation. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. The results of this trial do not support the routine use of higher dose nicotine patch therapy in the treatment of nicotine dependence. Future research should focus primarily on investigating ways to improve smoking quit rates for smokers in early alcohol recovery. The coping behavior of the BTP group may have been more effective than that of the BT group, as indicated by their significantly higher level of self-efficacy. Additionally, the nicotine patch provides relief from some tobacco withdrawal symptoms. Use of nicotine polacrilex gum, therefore, can substantially aid in stopping smoking, particularly among highly dependent smokers. The clinical importance of these findings is discussed. Although nicotine replacement therapy has improved our ability to produce smoking cessation, the production of sustained, longer term abstinence remains an elusive goal. The nicotine inhaler was an effective smoking cessation aid that produced a few mild and transient adverse effects. The patches were generally well tolerated, although 25% of subjects in the nicotine group and 13% in the placebo group had transient local erythema after application of the patch; 5 members of the nicotine group withdrew because of poor cutaneous tolerance. The suggestion that TNS produces an increase of 50% in relative terms (7% absolute increase) in smoking cessation over placebo in this population of hospital patients is sufficiently strong to warrant a further study large enough to answer whether or not this result was due to chance. The nicotine lozenge is a safe and effective new treatment for smoking cessation in low- and high-dependence smokers. Although no smokers relapsed to alcohol use, a trial that follows up all subjects is needed to verify this. The nicotine patch is efficacious in smoking cessation over a 6-month period, when combined with only self-help materials, three brief visits, and telephone counseling. However, efforts are needed to improve long-term abstinence rates and smoking outcomes among women with a history of depression. While the nicotine lozenge, bupropion, and bupropion plus lozenge produced effects that were comparable with those reported in previous research, the nicotine patch plus lozenge produced the greatest benefit relative to placebo for smoking cessation. Although nicotine gum did not increase quit rates, use of nicotine gum increased birth weight and gestational age, two key parameters in predicting neonatal wellbeing. The nicotine pre-treatment was equally effective in light and heavy smokers. Adding active gum use to active patch use in subjects smoking 10 cigarettes or more a day increased abstinence rates, which are statistically significant up to 24 weeks. In summary, a higher than standard dose of nicotine patch was associated with an increase in the long-term success in smoking cessation but continuation of treatment beyond 8-12 weeks did not increase the success rates. The nicotine sublingual tablet increased the smoking cessation rate compared to placebo, reduced craving in highly dependent smokers and was well tolerated. By 6 months most of the non-smokers had relapsed, but the nicotine gum group (23%) was more successful than the placebo (5% or the control group (14%). Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. However, the efficacy of transdermal nicotine as an aid to smoking cessation in such patients is limited and may not be sustained over time. Studies are needed to assess other interventions that may further improve quit rates among African American light smokers who are motivated to quit. Additional study of nicotine gum, with enhanced instructional support, is needed to assess its efficacy among adolescent smokers. Thus, NCG does appear to have a role in family practice for promoting short-term cessation. ). The likelihood of severe reactions at the site of application with repeated treatment is low. Consistent with earlier work, the study provided further support for the relationship between nicotine replacement level and post-cessation weight gain. Lack of power, contamination, and low attendance at reinforcing sessions should be taken into account in interpreting the results. However, the absolute rate of abstinence after one year was only 17 percent, which is lower than the rate in studies that have combined the use of nicotine chewing gum with behavioral therapy. Reduction with or without nicotine substitution may be a feasible first step towards smoking cessation in people not able or not willing to stop abruptly. Nicotine gum is an effective adjunct to minimal-contact smoking cessation materials plus monetary incentive in a population-based sample of smokers. In the absence of a placebo gum control group, expectancy cannot be eliminated as a possible explanation of the short-term results. OTC nicotine inhaler appears to be ineffective, though quit rates are improved with HCP assistance. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00296647. These results compare favorably with those reported from the more recent nicotine patch therapy. Self-reports of pretreatment craving predicted response to the nicotine exposure treatments. The study has implications for identifying the treatment needs of lighter smokers. Nicotine chewing gum is effective in improving the success rates in smoking cessation based on group therapy. The use of nicotine gum in appropriate doses should be helpful to persons who are attempting to stop smoking. Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake. History-positive smokers may be best treated by interventions providing additional support and contact, independent of therapeutic content. Mecamylamine before smoking cessation may be an effective adjunct to nicotine patch therapy. Starting nicotine gum treatment 4 weeks before the target quit date was no more effective than starting treatment on the quit date. Agonist-antagonist therapy, consisting of the nicotine patch with oral mecamylamine, may substantially improve current smoking cessation treatment. We conclude that research on different gum chewing regimens is warranted and that further examination of possible gender differences in response to replacement therapy is needed. Among reducers, the toxin intake correlated with reduced cigarette consumption although some compensatory smoking occurred. In view of these findings and similar results from previous studies, current labeling of the nicotine patch, which recommends using nicotine replacement therapy only after the quit date, should be reexamined. Few side effects were reported. All rights reserved. The results of the present study provide no support for the use of naltrexone, alone or in combination with nicotine patches, as a therapeutic treatment for smoking cessation. Our results, although not yet verified by long-term observations, demonstrate that transdermal nicotine substitution significantly enhances the effectiveness of behavioral smoking cessation methods. All but one of the 96 subjects eventually achieving long-term abstinence in the study quit during the first week of cessation. Nicotine nasal spray in combination with group treatment is an effective aid to smoking cessation. The value of nicotine chewing gum, if any, can be quite small when it is used in general practice. The authors conclude that fixed-dose transdermal nicotine, tapered-dose transdermal nicotine, and buspirone are associated with similar efficacy and safety when combined with behavior modification in smoking cessation. No significant differences in smoking cessation rates were seen among smokers who started with the low-dose nicotine or placebo patches. The "dose-response" pattern suggests that cognitive-behavioral could be the reasonable option in the smoking cessation therapy. We recommend that physicians and health care professionals recommend exercise and NRT together for highly motivated women interested in quitting smoking. These assessments, taken together, can help match most smokers with optimal NRT doses and help rapidly identify some who may be better treated using other methods. We found no significant individual difference variables that moderated outcome beyond 1 week postquit. More data are needed to determine safety parameters and to confirm the efficacy of NRT use during pregnancy. Hospital interventions for smoking cessation may be most effective among patients hospitalized for a smoking-related illness such as respiratory disease. A 2:1 quit rate advantage was achieved at week 6 and was maintained at 24 weeks. We concluded that the nicotine 2-mg sublingual tablet was effective as a smoking cessation aid. Achieving a greater percentage of nicotine replacement may increase the efficacy of nicotine patch therapy. If replicated by all general practitioners throughout the country the yield of ex-smokers would be about one million a year. Our results suggest the dose-response curves differ for nicotine gum's reinforcing, withdrawal-suppression and self-reported effects. In this setting the nicotine inhaler appeared safe to use and increased success rates of smoking cessation attempts. Smoking history and demographic variables also have a significant impact on the outcome of a quit-smoking attempt. Longer durations of treatment may be necessary to show greater advantages from higher doses. In an over-the-counter environment, the 22-mg, 24-hour nicotine patch is effective and safe for smoking cessation treatment."

Intravenous erythromycin in antimicrobial doses is unlikely to benefit the introduction of feeding in preterm infants.

Oral EM was effective and safe for treatment of feeding intolerance in preterm infants. Erythromycin-related side-effects did not occur.

468,CD003412,"Imiquimod 5% cream shows clinical efficacy in the treatment of BCC. Methyl aminolevulinate PDT is an effective treatment for nodular BCC, and while there is a trend for higher recurrence with this modality, it conveys the advantage over surgery of better cosmesis. Thus, in the treatment of BCC of the face of less than 4 cm in diameter, surgery should be preferred to radiotherapy. Topical 5% imiquimod cream is well tolerated and most effective in treating nodular BCC when applied once daily for 7 days per week for either 12 or 6 weeks. Occlusion did not have a statistically significant effect on efficacy for either superficial or nodular BCC tumours. These results suggest that IFN alfa-2a, 2b, and the combination of 2a and 2b appear to be effective choices for the treatment of BCC; the effectiveness is not increased by their combination. Imiquimod 5% cream administered 7 x/week for 6 weeks is a safe and effective treatment for sBCC when compared with vehicle cream. A single course of verteporfin PDT showed treatment benefit for patients with multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers. A sustained-release protamine zinc preparation of interferon alfa-2b shows promise as a practical, effective, and cosmetically elegant treatment for basal cell carcinoma. Although the study was unable to detect any statistically significant differences in outcome between the study groups, this small pilot study shows preliminary findings which may indicate an increase in the short-term eradication of BCC using a PC-based vehicle as compared to conventional petrolatum-based formulations. For some patients with noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas, intralesional interferon alfa-2b may be an alternative, effective treatment. Results demonstrate that treatment of BCC with 5-FU/epi gel is both safe and effective, may result in histologically confirmed complete response rates comparable to surgery, and provides a nonsurgical treatment alternative in selected patients. It is concluded that cryotherapy does not offer a satisfactory alternative to radiotherapy in the treatment of basal-cell carcinomas. Daily or 5 times a week dosing for 12 weeks demonstrated high efficacy results with acceptable safety profiles. The 5x/week regimen is recommended. Cost and safety are further elements in favor of the BL in this setting. Although recurrence rates were lower after MMS than after SE, the differences were not significant. Imiquimod 5% cream appears to have potential as a patient-administered treatment option in sBCC."

Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings and to assess the long-term effects of laparoscopy."
394,CD000432,"Caffeine may have a beneficial effect on the short-term outcomes of preterm infants with hypoxaemia. However, the evidence is based on a small number of small trials with short follow-up and the results are not reliable. Further trials are needed to confirm the beneficial effects of caffeine on the long-term outcome of pre term infants with hyperoxaemic seizures."
395,CD006655,"The evidence from the two included trials is insufficient to determine whether TLH is superior to TAH in terms of survival, quality of life or cost. The results of the one trial comparing TLH with TAH suggest that TLH may be associated with a better quality of Life and a shorter hospital stay, but the evidence is not strong enough to support this conclusion."

Further research is needed to determine if tubal surgery is associated either with a significant difference in pregnancy or a significant reduction in pregnancy rates.
410,CD004504,"Harpagophytum extract is effective for treating acute and chronic pain, and may be useful for pain relief in people with chronic conditions such as cancer, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and fibromyalgia.

411,CD009118,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of lactitol for the treatment of children with chronic constipation.
412,CD005214,The evidence from the two included studies was limited. The first study showed that the use of depot-only contraceptives was associated with a lower risk of OHSS than the use with progestogen-only contraception. The second study showed no difference between the two types of contraceptive. The use of depots was associated by women with a higher risk of amenorrhoea.

However, the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the small sample sizes. The use of AAV in a single injection cannot be recommended at this time."
425,CD000297,"Cyclosporine is effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. The small number of patients included in the trials and the small sample sizes of the included studies limit the generalisability of the results. However, the small number and small sample size of the studies do not exclude a clinically important benefit."

435,CD002122,"The evidence from the included trials was limited by the small number of patients, small sample size, and lack of methodological quality. The results suggest that the use of progestogens in the treatment of endometriosis is associated with a significant improvement in amenorrhea and a reduction in the risk of recurrent pain. However, the evidence is based on a small number and the quality of the evidence was variable. The quality of evidence for the use in the management of endo-related pain was poor."
436,CD000972,"Dexamethasone is effective in treating cerebral malaria. However, the quality of the evidence is poor. The trials included in this review were small and of poor quality. The drug is not recommended for treating cerebral malignancies."
437,CD003420,"The evidence from the included trials was limited. The levothyroxine-free regimen was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of relapse after cessation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy, but the evidence from a subgroup analysis of the pooled data suggests that the effect of levothyroid therapy on the risk for relapse after discontinuation of thyroid hormones is not clear. The evidence from one small trial suggests that thyroid hormone reduction may be associated with an increased risk of adverse events."

Interferon is effective for treating liver-related serious adverse events, including hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-associated infections. Interfenol-2a is effective at treating liver related adverse events."
439,CD001261,"The evidence from this review suggests that the non-reactogenic vaccine is effective in preventing salmonella typhi fever. The vaccine was more effective than the oral vaccine in preventing all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. The safety profile of the vaccine was good, but the safety profile was not. The non-reactive vaccine was associated with a higher rate of adverse events than the Oral vaccine."
440,CD008765,"The evidence from the included trials was limited. The majority of trials were small and of poor quality. There is no evidence to support the use of surgery over cytoreduction for recurrent ovarian cancer. The one trial that was included in this review showed that surgery was associated with a reduction in overall mortality compared with complete cytoregery. However, the evidence is based on a small number of small trials with poor quality and the risk of bias was high. Further well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to assess the role of surgery versus cytorexia in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancers."
441,CD005331,"The limited evidence available suggests that paradoxical therapy may be effective in treating conversion disorder. However, the quality of the evidence is poor. The trials were small, of poor methodological quality and had a high risk of bias. The results should be interpreted with caution as they were based on a small number of studies with few participants and were heterogeneous. Further research is needed to determine the optimal type and duration of treatment, the optimal duration of therapy, the best way to deliver the therapy and to assess the effects of different types of paradoxical interventions."
442,CD002037,"The evidence from this review suggests that a less intensive maintenance regimen of indinavir and zidovudine is more effective than a combination regimen of both indinaviral and zithrombopurine.

456,CD003581,The evidence from this review suggests that antenatal education is effective in reducing the number of women presenting to antenatal clinics for antenatal care. The evidence from the two included studies was limited by the small number of studies and the small sample sizes. There is a need for more studies with larger sample sizes and more rigorous design.
457,CD003200,"There is some evidence that educational interventions can improve the quality of life of people with CFS. However, the evidence is limited.

463,CD003700,"VAS may be beneficial in children with pneumonia. However, the evidence is limited. The trials included in this review were of short duration and of poor quality. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment for children with acute pneumonia."
464,CD003412,"Imiquimod 5% cream appears to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with Basal cell carcinoma. However, the evidence is based on a small number of patients and the quality of the evidence was poor. The quality of evidence for other topical treatments was poor, and the number of participants in the included trials was small. There is a need for more RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of topical imiquimid 5% in the management of Basal Cell carcinoma, and to compare it with other topical therapies."
465,CD004979,The use of antibiotics in children with pneumonia is not recommended. The current evidence suggests that antibiotics are effective in reducing the duration of hospitalisation and mortality in children under five years of age with severe pneumonia.

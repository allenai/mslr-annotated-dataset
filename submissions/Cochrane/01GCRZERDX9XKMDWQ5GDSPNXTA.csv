0,CD000220,"Treatment of asymptomatic trichomoniasis with metronidazole 48 hours or 48 hours apart does not prevent preterm birth in women with trichomiasis. However, it does reduce the risk of caesarean section and the time of birth. [Note: The four citations in the awaiting classification section may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"
1,CD008120,"Olanzapine and risperidone showed statistically significant improvement over placebo in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Social Phobia Scale and SDI, respectively, but there were no statistically significant differences in overall responders.

17,CD003687,"Eutrophic electrotherapy appears to be more effective than uniform 10 Hz electrical stimulation for the treatment of fatigue-resistant hands. However, this conclusion is based on a small number of studies and the results of the studies are imprecise due to the heterogeneity of the populations, the small sample sizes and the generally low methodological quality of the included studies. Further research is required to determine the optimal intensity and frequency of EUTC and its effectiveness."

100,CD004918,"There is no evidence that adjunctive MMC reduces the risk of IOP compared with standard MMC. Adjunctive IOP was lower at six months in the MMC group than at one year in the trabeculectomy group. There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of postoperative visual acuity or IOP between the two groups. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether MMC increases or decreases the risks of post-operative IOP. The decision to use MMC for the treatment of refractory glaucoma should be based on the surgeon's experience and the patient's preferences."

457,CD008253,"There is some evidence that betamethasone nasal drops may reduce polyp size in people with cystic fibrosis. However, this evidence is based on a small number of studies with a high risk of bias. Further large randomised controlled trials are needed."
458,CD000948,"Orotracheal intubation may be preferable to nasotracheal in neonates requiring ventilatory resuscitation. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine which route of intubations is preferred."

461,CD003200,"There is some evidence that self-administered graded exercise in people with chronic fatigue syndrome improves physical functioning. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of graded exercise as a treatment for chronic fatigue."

469,CD004979,"The available evidence does not support the use of oral antibiotics for pneumonia in children aged three to 59 months. However, the available evidence suggests that oral antibiotics are more effective than either procaine or ampicillin in the treatment of pneumonia in young Gambian children."

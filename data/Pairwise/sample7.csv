Further trials are needed to assess the effects of these agents on DKD and to assess their effect on patient-important outcomes.
CD002911,"Alarm interventions are an effective treatment for nocturnal bedwetting in children. Alarms appear more effective than desmopressin or tricyclics because around half the children remain dry after alarm treatment stops. Overlearning (giving extra fluids at bedtime after successfully becoming dry using an alarm), dry bed training and avoiding penalties may further reduce the relapse rate. Better quality research comparing alarms with other treatments is needed, including follow-up to determine relapse rates.",PX7SGV,There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of alarm therapy for children with nocturnal enuresis.,AQ85CE,Alarm is effective in reducing the number of wet nights spent in bed and the number wet nights experienced by children. The effect of alarms on wet nights is less clear when compared with desmopressin. The effectiveness of alarms compared with other interventions is unknown.

CD008510,"There was insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicines alone for treating threatened miscarriage.
A combination of Chinese herbal and Western medicines was more effective than Western medicines alone for treating threatened miscarriage. However, the quality of the included studies was poor. More high quality studies are necessary to further evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicines for threatened miscarriage.",AQ85CE,The evidence from the two included trials is insufficient to determine whether the use of progesterone or Zhixue Baotai Decoction is effective in the prevention of threatened abortion.

CD002964,"Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.",VNCH8M,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of videotape as a means of improving parenting skills among young people.,AQ85CE,"The review provides some evidence that parenting interventions can improve the quality of life of adolescent mothers and their infants.

CD003200,"There is encouraging evidence that some patients may benefit from exercise therapy and no evidence that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes on average. However the treatment may be less acceptable to patients than other management approaches, such as rest or pacing. Patients with CFS who are similar to those in these trials should be offered exercise therapy, and their progress monitored Further high quality randomised studies are needed.",8FWF5T,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome.

CD006726,"There is evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for treating PTSD in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. At this stage, there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of one psychological therapy compared to others. There is also not enough evidence to conclude that children and adolescents with particular types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to psychological therapies than others.
The findings of this review are limited by the potential for methodological biases, and the small number and generally small size of identified studies. In addition, there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity in some analyses which could not be explained by subgroup or sensitivity analyses.
More evidence is required for the effectiveness of all psychological therapies more than one month after treatment. Much more evidence is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies or the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared to other treatments. More details are required in future trials in regards to the types of trauma that preceded the diagnosis of PTSD and whether the traumas are single event or ongoing. Future studies should also aim to identify the most valid and reliable measures of PTSD symptoms and ensure that all scores, total and sub-scores, are consistently reported.",PX7SGV,There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of psychosocial interventions for children with posttraumatic stress disorder.,VNCH8M,"Psychological therapy is an effective treatment for PTSD in children and adolescents.

CD005562,"There was consistent evidence from multiple trials that cognitive stimulation programmes benefit cognition in people with mild to moderate dementia over and above any medication effects. However, the trials were of variable quality with small sample sizes and only limited details of the randomisation method were apparent in a number of the trials. Other outcomes need more exploration but improvements in self-reported quality of life and well-being were promising. Further research should look into the potential benefits of longer term cognitive stimulation programmes and their clinical significance.",AQ85CE,"Cognitive communication interventions may have a beneficial effect on some aspects of cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

CD003412,"Overall there has been very little good quality research on treatments for BCC. Most trials have only evaluated BCCs in low risk locations. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments with surgery showing the lowest failure rates. Although cosmetic outcomes appear good with PDT, long-term follow-up data are needed. Other treatments might have some use but few have been compared to surgery. An ongoing study comparing imiquimod to surgery should clarify whether imiquimod is a useful option.",SPNXTA,"There is some evidence that topical interferon is more effective than surgery for the treatment of superficial BCC. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of this cream over other treatments.",AQ85CE,"Imiquimod 5% cream appears to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with Basal cell carcinoma. However, the evidence is based on a small number of patients and the quality of the evidence was poor.

Further randomised controlled trials are needed.,VNCH8M,There is no evidence to support the use of NCPAP for elective extubation of preterm infants.
CD004957,"Based on the heterogeneity and the low quality of the included trials that precluded pooled meta-analysis, there is silver level evidence that following hip or knee joint replacement, early multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve outcomes at the level of activity and participation. The optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. Future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis.",SPNXTA,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of clinical pathways for patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty.,AQ85CE,There is evidence that the provision of a clinical pathway to patients following hip and knee arthroplasty reduces the length of stay in hospital and the length and duration of hospital stay in the short term. There is no evidence that this benefit is associated with an increase in the rate of complications or readmissions.
CD004585,"Despite evidence from a small number of individual studies to suggest that EMG-BFB plus standard physiotherapy produces improvements in motor power, functional recovery and gait quality when compared to standard physiotherapy alone, combination of all the identified studies did not find a treatment benefit.

Further research is needed to determine whether lactation supports the prevention or treatment of pain in term newborn infants.
CD005137,In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.,AQ85CE,"The limited evidence available suggests that 2 hours of daily photocoagulation is more effective than 6 hours of continuous photocoage in the treatment of mild amblyopia in children younger than 7 years of age. However, the evidence is based on a small number of small trials with short follow-up periods and is not strong enough to support the routine use of daily patching in this population.",JB6Z8F,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either full or partial patching for the treatment of amblyopia. Further trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment for amblyopia.
CD003917,"No definitive conclusions can be made about the efficacy of cardioprotective agents for which pooling of results was impossible. Dexrazoxane prevents heart damage and no evidence for a difference in response rate or survival between the dexrazoxane and control groups was identified. The evidence available did not allow us to reach any definite conclusions about adverse effects. We conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines. However, clinicians should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects for each individual patient.",8FWF5T,There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of dexrazoxane in patients with advanced breast cancer.,VNCH8M,Dexrazoxane reduces cardiotoxicity in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. Dexrazoxane also reduces cardiotoxicity in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with chemotherapy.
CD000123,"Lipid-lowering therapy is effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in people with PAD. It may also improve local symptoms. Until further evidence on the relative effectiveness of different lipid-lowering agents is available, use of a statin in people with PAD and a blood cholesterol level ≥ 3.5 mmol/litre is most indicated.",AQ85CE,"Atorvastatin appears to be effective in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with IC.

CD006107,"The studies are limited by their quality with only two studies reporting details of both computerised randomisation techniques and adequate allocation concealment. Ultrasound guidance does appear to improve the chances of live/ongoing and clinical pregnancies compared with clinical touch methods. The quality of future studies should be improved with adequate reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and power calculations.

CD000246,"This review fails to demonstrate a clear overall benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment for preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. This treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. Further research may be justified (when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available) in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture, and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective.

CD006616,"Overall, this meta-analysis puts doubt on the safety and utility of intravenous N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy in SIRS and sepsis. At best, N-acetylcysteine is ineffective in reducing mortality and complications in this patient population. At worst, it can be harmful, especially when administered later than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, by causing cardiovascular depression. Unless future RCTs provide evidence of treatment effect, clinicians should not routinely use intravenous N-acetylcysteine in SIRS or sepsis and academics should not promote its use.",PX7SGV,There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of N-acetylcysteine in the treatment of patients with ALI/ARDS.

CD003581,"There is no evidence, either supporting or refuting the use of bed rest at home or in hospital, to prevent preterm birth. Although bed rest in hospital or at home is widely used as the first step of treatment, there is no evidence that this practice could be beneficial. Due to the potential adverse effects that bed rest could have on women and their families, and the increased costs for the healthcare system, clinicians should not routinely advise women to rest in bed to prevent preterm birth. Potential benefits and harms should be discussed with women facing an increased risk of preterm birth. Appropriate research is mandatory. Future trials should evaluate both the effectiveness of bed rest, and the effectiveness of the prescription of bed rest, to prevent preterm birth.

CD004740,"There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:
Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid.
The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed.
Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision.
Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.",JB6Z8F,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical or topical corticosteroids for the treatment of otitis externa.,8FWF5T,There is no evidence to support the use of topical otic preparations for the treatment of acute otitis externa.

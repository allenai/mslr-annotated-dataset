CD004737	Delivery of the placenta with cord traction at caesarean section has more advantages compared to manual removal. These are less endometritis; less blood loss; less decrease in haematocrit levels postoperatively; and shorter duration of hospital stay. Future trials should provide information on interval between the delivery of the infant and of the placenta, change in lochia, blood splashing during placental removal and uterine pain after operation, as well as the effects of delayed cord clamping.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the routine removal of the placenta at cesarean section. Further research is needed.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence that manual placenta extraction is associated with a significant increase in operative blood loss or postoperative endometritis.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD003231	The data from the present meta-analysis indicate that tumour recurrence was significantly reduced with intravesical BCG compared to MMC only in the subgroup of patients at high risk of tumour recurrence. However, there was no difference in terms of disease progression or survival, and the decision to use either agent might be based on adverse events and cost.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether intravesical therapy is more or less effective than immunotherapy in the treatment of recurrent bladder cancer. Further well-designed randomised trials are required to answer this question.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether immunotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether immunotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer.	A	correct PI, wrong O
CD004888	Peginterferon plus ribavirin may be considered a treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C and stable HIV who have not received treatment for hepatitis C as the intervention may clear the blood of HCV RNA. Supporting evidence comes mainly from the analysis of this non-validated surrogate outcome assessed in comparisons against other antiviral treatments. There is no evidence on treatment of patients who have relapsed or did not respond to previous therapy. Careful monitoring of adverse events is warranted.	VNCH8M	Interferon-ribavirin is more effective than interferon-peg-INF in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients. However, the adverse events associated with interferon-ribavirin are higher and the duration of treatment longer.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pegylated interferon-alfa-2b plus ribavirin for the treatment of HCV infection in HIV-infected patients.	B	
CD003654	Diuretics are preferred first-line over CCBs to optimize reduction of cardiovascular events. The review does not distinguish between CCBs, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, but does provide evidence supporting the use of CCBs over β-blockers. Many of the differences found in the current review are not robust and further trials might change the conclusions. More well-designed RCTs studying the mortality and morbidity of patients taking CCBs as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension, different ages, and with different co-morbidities such as diabetes.	8FWF5T	There is some evidence that calcium channel blockers reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with renal disease. The is no evidence that calcium channel blockers reduce the risk of renal disease progression or mortality.	SPNXTA	Corticosteroids and calcium channel blockers reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in hypertensive patients. However, there is no evidence to support the use of calcium antagonists in patients with mild hypertension.	A	
CD007289	P-Chem may reduce the risk of progression to GTN in women with CMs who are at a high risk of malignant transformation; however, current evidence in favour of P-Chem is limited by the poor methodological quality and small size of the included studies. As P-Chem may increase drug resistance, delay treatment of GTN and expose women unnecessarily to toxic side effects, this practice cannot currently be recommended.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of prophylactic chemotherapy for patients with persistent trophoblastic disease. The results suggest that prophylactic chemotherapy may be beneficial in patients at high risk of developing secondary malignancy. The is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal prophylactic chemotherapy for patients with persistent trophoblastic disease.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chemotherapy for patients with complete hydatidiform mole.	A	
CD002815	Considering the small number of patients examined, the methodological flaws in many of the studies and the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of any given form of physiotherapy over another in Parkinson's disease. Another Cochrane review, Physiotherapy for patients with Parkinson's Disease, found that there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of physiotherapy compared to no physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease.  A wide range of physiotherapy approaches were used in these studies and a survey of UK physiotherapists confirmed that they also use an eclectic combination of techniques in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Plant 1999). Therefore a consensus must be found as to 'best practice' physiotherapy for Parkinson's disease. The efficacy of 'standard' physiotherapy should be proved first before examining variations in physiotherapy methods. Therefore large well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to judge the effect of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. After this large RCTs are needed to demonstrate the most effective form of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients, carers, physiotherapists and physicians should be chosen and the patients monitored for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any effect. The trials should be reported according to CONSORT guidelines (CONSORT 1996).	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of RAS in the management of patients with Parkinson's disease.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of music-based interventions for people with idiopathic myasthenia gravis. The research should focus on the use of music-based interventions for people with idiopathic myasthenia gravis.	A	
CD003654	Diuretics are preferred first-line over CCBs to optimize reduction of cardiovascular events. The review does not distinguish between CCBs, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, but does provide evidence supporting the use of CCBs over β-blockers. Many of the differences found in the current review are not robust and further trials might change the conclusions. More well-designed RCTs studying the mortality and morbidity of patients taking CCBs as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension, different ages, and with different co-morbidities such as diabetes.	AQ85CE	There is no evidence to support the use of ACEi in the prevention of CKD in people with hypertension.	VNCH8M	ACE inhibitors are effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of ACE inhibitors over other first-line treatments for hypertension.	B	
CD007771	The evidence base for the use of vitamin D for chronic pain in adults is poor at present. This is due to low quality and insufficient randomised controlled trials in this area of research.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin D for the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.	AQ85CE	Alfacalcidol is effective in the treatment of RA. Its adverse effects are mild and probably not life threatening.	A	
CD008493	Preoperative statin therapy reduces the odds of post-operative AF and shortens the stay on the ICU and in the hospital. Statin pretreatment had no influence on perioperative mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction or renal failure. Since analysed studies included mainly patients undergoing myocardial revascularizations the results cannot be extrapolated to patients undergoing other cardiac procedures such as heart valve or aortic surgery.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of statins in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of statins in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of statins in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.	AQ85CE	Statins may reduce the risk of MI and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. However, the evidence is based on a small number of small trials with high risk of bias. The effect of statins on mortality and on major morbidity is unknown.	B	
CD001874	There is no evidence that the use of perioperative local anaesthetic in patients undergoing tonsillectomy improves post-operative pain control. The trials identified were of small size and several involved the perioperative co-administration of intravenous opiates which may have masked any beneficial effect of the local anaesthetic. Further randomised controlled trials are necessary.	AQ85CE	There is no evidence to support the use of any specific surgical intervention for patients undergoing bilateral tonsillectomy. The use of bupivacaine, tonsillar infiltration with 0.25% bupiva, or isotonic saline infusion may reduce pain and may reduce the need for analgesia.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence to support the use of bupivacaine for the control of postoperative pain control in adults undergoing tonsillectomy.	B	
CD001342	For the secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke after TIA or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that vitamin K antagonists in any dose are not more efficacious than antiplatelet therapy and that medium and high intensity anticoagulation leads to a significant increase in major bleeding complications.	SPNXTA	Oral anticoagulants are more effective than aspirin in the prevention of transient ischaemic stroke or RIND. However, there is no evidence to support the use of these drugs in the treatment of patients with non-valuable ischaemia.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke in patients with transient ischaemic stroke.	B	
CD001705	Insufficient evidence exists from randomised trials to confirm the relative effects of open versus closed reduction of intracapsular fractures, or the effects of intra-operative impaction or compression of an intracapsular fracture treated by internal fixation.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of closed-plate fixation for the treatment of displaced neck fractures. The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of closed-plate fixation for the treatment of displaced neck fractures.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal timing of internal fixation for displaced intracapsular fractures of the neck of the femur.	A	
CD003940	Five new studies were added to the review, but their results do not alter the final conclusion of the review. Implications for practiceDue to there being only one study in children, it is not possible to make recommendations for treatment or prevention of OC in children. Amongst adults, there were few studies per comparison. Due to insufficient evidence, no conclusion could be made about the effectiveness of clotrimazole, nystatin, amphotericin B, itraconazole or ketoconazole with regard to OC prophylaxis. In comparison to placebo, fluconazole is an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop, as well as the cost of prophylaxis, might impact the feasibility of implementation. No studies were found comparing fluconazole with other interventions. The direction of findings suggests that ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and clotrimazole improved the treatment outcomes. Implications for researchIt is encouraging that low-cost alternatives are being tested, but more research needs to be on in this area and on interventions like gentian violet and other less expensive anti-fungal drugs to treat OC. More well-designed treatment trials with larger samples are needed to allow for sufficient power to detect differences in not only clinical, but also mycological, response and relapse rates. There is also a strong need for more research to be done on the treatment and prevention of OC in children as it is reported that OC is the most frequent fungal infection in children and adolescents who are HIV positive. More research on the effectiveness of less expensive interventions also needs to be done in resource-poor settings. Currently few trials report outcomes related to quality of life, nutrition, or survival. Future researchers should consider measuring these when planning trials. Development of resistance remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area. It is recommended that trials be more standardised and conform more closely to CONSORT.	SPNXTA	Itraconazole is an effective prophylaxis in preventing oral candidiasis in HIV-positive patients. Itraconaziole may be more effective in preventing oropharyngeal candidiasis than fluconazole. However, there is no evidence to support the use of any of the other antifungal drugs.	VNCH8M	Fluconazole is an effective treatment for oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients. However, the use of fluconazole in combination with systemic antifungal therapy is associated with increased risk of adverse events.	B	
CD008449	The results indicate evidence for the effectiveness of mirror therapy for improving upper extremity motor function, activities of daily living and pain, at least as an adjunct to normal rehabilitation for patients after stroke. Limitations are due to small sample sizes of most included studies, control interventions that are not used routinely in stroke rehabilitation and some methodological limitations of the studies.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of mirror therapy for the rehabilitation of the affected upper limb after stroke.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of mirror therapy for improving hand function in stroke patients.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	A == B
CD008361	We could not find convincing evidence that NBI is significantly better than high definition WLC for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas. We found evidence that NBI might be better than standard definition WLC and equal to high definition WLC for detection the patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of adenoid coloscopy for the detection of colonic adenomas. The results of this review suggest that the use of adenoid coloscopy is associated with a significant increase in the detection of colonic adenomas. The results of this review suggest that the use of adenoid coloscopy is associated with a significant increase in the detection of colonic adenomas.	AQ85CE	There is evidence that NBI improves the detection of colorectal adenomatous polyps in colorespiratory endoscopy. The evidence is weak and inconclusive. The results of this review suggest that NII may be associated with a small reduction in the risk of colorem adenoma.	B	
CD001342	For the secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke after TIA or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that vitamin K antagonists in any dose are not more efficacious than antiplatelet therapy and that medium and high intensity anticoagulation leads to a significant increase in major bleeding complications.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke in patients with transient ischaemic stroke.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of aspirin or warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular coronary artery disease. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of either drug for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular coronary artery disease.	A	
CD003700	The evidence does not suggest a significant reduction in mortality, measures of morbidity, nor an effect on the clinical course of pneumonia with vitamin A adjunctive treatment in children with non-measles pneumonia. However, not all studies measured all outcomes, which limited the number of studies that could be incorporated into the meta-analyses, so that there may have been a lack of statistical power to detect statistically significant differences.	JB6Z8F	There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of vitamin A supplementation in the treatment of pneumonia in children.	AQ85CE	VAS may be beneficial in children with pneumonia. However, the evidence is limited. The trials included in this review were of short duration and of poor quality. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment for children with acute pneumonia.	A	
CD008493	Preoperative statin therapy reduces the odds of post-operative AF and shortens the stay on the ICU and in the hospital. Statin pretreatment had no influence on perioperative mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction or renal failure. Since analysed studies included mainly patients undergoing myocardial revascularizations the results cannot be extrapolated to patients undergoing other cardiac procedures such as heart valve or aortic surgery.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of preoperative statins in the prevention of postoperative AF in patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting surgery.	SPNXTA	Prophylactic use of statins to reduce the risk of perioperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery is associated with a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events and the length of hospital stay.	B	
CD002964	Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of videotape as a means of improving parenting skills among adolescents.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence to suggest that culturally sensitive videotape may be beneficial for improving parent-infant interaction. However, the evidence is too limited to draw any conclusions. Further research is needed to assess the effects of culturally insensitive videotape on infant and social functioning.	B	
CD002964	Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of videotape as a means of improving parenting skills among young people.	AQ85CE	The review provides some evidence that parenting interventions can improve the quality of life of adolescent mothers and their infants. However, the evidence is limited and the results are heterogeneous. The review highlights the need for more research to be conducted in this area.	B	
CD005582	There is moderate quality evidence that corticosteroids given acutely during zoster infection are ineffective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. In people with acute herpes zoster the risks of administration of corticosteroids do not appear to be greater than with placebo, based on moderate quality evidence. Corticosteroids have been recommended to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the two included trials suggests that a short course of antiviral therapy (≥ 7 days) is more effective than a longer course (≤ 7 days), but the evidence from one trial suggests that the addition of corticosteroids to antiviral treatment is not better than a short treatment course alone. The addition of steroids to antivirals is associated with a significant increase in postherpetic neuralgia and genital ulceration. The use of cortics in the treatment of herpes zoster is not recommended.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of prednisolone in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. The use of corticosteroids in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia is not supported by the available evidence.	B	
CD009275	Data for most comparisons were only available from single studies and they are too small for reliable conclusions about which types of dietary advice are the most suitable for women with GDM. Based on the current available evidence, we did not find any significant benefits of the diets investigated. Further larger trials with sufficient power to assess the effects of different diets for women with GDM on maternal and infant health outcomes are needed. Outcomes such as longer-term health outcomes for women and their babies, women's quality of life and health service cost should be included.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of a low glycaemic index diet for women with gestational diabetes.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary interventions to improve glucose control in women with gestational diabetes. The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of dietary interventions to improve glucose control in women with gestational diabetes. The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of dietary interventions to improve glucose control in women with gestational diabetes.	B	
CD003804	There is no convincing evidence relating type or intensity of diabetic treatment to the prevention or management of cognitive impairment in Type II diabetes. Future research on treatments for diabetes should include standardized assessments of cognitive function as outcome measures.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ginseng analogues for the treatment of patients with diabetes. The is a need for well-designed, well-powered, and adequately powered randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of ginseng analogues for the treatment of patients with diabetes.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of ginseng for the management of NIDDM.	A	
CD000143	Implications for practice: nasal CPAP is effective in preventing failure of extubation in preterm infants following a period of endotracheal intubation and IPPV. Implication for research: further definition of the gestational age and weight groups in whom these results apply is warranted. Optimal levels of NCPAP as well as methods of administration remain to be determined.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure for early extubation in preterm infants. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure for early extubation in preterm infants.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CPAP in preterm infants to facilitate the removal of mechanical ventilation. Further research is needed to determine the optimal CPAP strategy.	B	
CD004998	The small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. Transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation. Drop out rates appear to be high, and adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of meditation for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of meditation for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	A	support or refute vs just support (technically more correct)
CD007033	Placebo-controlled trials have established the benefits of both long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy for COPD patients as individual therapies. This review, which included trials allowing comparisons between LABA and ICS, has shown that the two therapies confer similar benefits across the majority of outcomes, including the frequency of exacerbations and mortality. Use of long-acting beta-agonists appears to confer a small additional benefit in terms of improvements in lung function compared to inhaled corticosteroids. On the other hand, inhaled corticosteroid therapy shows a small advantage over long-acting beta-agonist therapy in terms of health-related quality of life, but inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of pneumonia. This review supports current guidelines advocating long-acting beta-agonists as frontline therapy for COPD, with regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy as an adjunct in patients experiencing frequent exacerbations.	VNCH8M	Budesonide is an effective treatment for COPD. The combination of formoterol and budesonide is more effective than either individual drug alone.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD.	A	
CD006717	The currently available evidence from trials reporting clinically relevant outcomes is low quality and insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of taping, whether used on its own or as part of a treatment programme. Further research involving large, preferably multi-centre, good quality and well reported randomised controlled trials that measure clinically important outcomes and long-term results is warranted. Before this, consensus is required on the diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, the standardisation of outcome measurement and an acceptable approach for patellar taping.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of taping in the treatment of patellofemoral pain.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of patellar taping for patellofemoral pain. Further research is required.	A

CD000143	Implications for practice: nasal CPAP is effective in preventing failure of extubation in preterm infants following a period of endotracheal intubation and IPPV. Implication for research: further definition of the gestational age and weight groups in whom these results apply is warranted. Optimal levels of NCPAP as well as methods of administration remain to be determined.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of NCPAP for elective extubation of preterm infants.	SPNXTA	The use of NCPAP in preterm infants reduces the risk of reintubation and oxygen dependency, but not the requirement for additional support. There is no evidence of a difference in respiratory failure between the two methods of extubation.	B	
CD005522	Tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol decreases pain intensity, produces symptom relief and improves function, but these benefits are small. Adverse events, although reversible and not life threatening, often cause participants to stop taking the medication and could limit tramadol or tramadol plus paracetamol usefulness.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tramadol for the treatment of chronic pain in patients with osteoarthritis. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of tramadol for the treatment of chronic pain in patients with osteoarthritis.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tramadol as an add-on treatment for OA.	B	
CD007718	Telehealthcare in COPD appears to have a possible impact on the quality of life of patients and the number of times patients attend the emergency department and the hospital. However, further research is needed to clarify precisely its role since the trials included telehealthcare as part of more complex packages.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of telehealthcare interventions for COPD patients.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence that telemedicine is more effective than other forms of home care for COPD patients.	A	
CD000432	The results of this review do not support the use of prophylactic caffeine for preterm infants at risk of apnoea. Any future studies need to examine the effects of prophylactic methylxanthines in preterm infants at higher risk of apnoea. This should include examination of important clinical outcomes such as need for IPPV, neonatal morbidity, length of hospital stay and long term development.	AQ85CE	Caffeine may have a beneficial effect on the short-term outcomes of preterm infants with hypoxaemia. However, the evidence is based on a small number of small trials with short follow-up and the results are not reliable. Further trials are needed to confirm the beneficial effects of caffeine on the long-term outcome of pre term infants with hyperoxaemic seizures.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of caffeine for the treatment of preterm infants with apnoea.	B	
CD004409	From the single, small and ill-reported, included study, the hostel ward type of facility appeared cheaper and positively effective. Currently, the value of this way of supporting people - which could be considerable - is unclear. Trials are needed. Any 24 hour care 'ward-in-a-house' is likely to be oversubscribed. We argue that the only equitable way of providing care in this way is to draw lots as to who is allocated a place from the eligible group of people with serious mental illness. With follow-up of all eligible for the placements - those who were lucky enough to be allocated a place as well as people in more standard type of care - real-world evaluation could take place. In the UK further randomised control trials are probably impossible, as many of these types of facilities have closed. The broader lesson of this review is to ensure early and rigorous evaluation of fashionable innovations before they are superseded by new approaches.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hostel ward care for long-stay patients. Further research is needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hostel care for people with schizophrenia.	B	
CD006616	Overall, this meta-analysis puts doubt on the safety and utility of intravenous N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy in SIRS and sepsis. At best, N-acetylcysteine is ineffective in reducing mortality and complications in this patient population. At worst, it can be harmful, especially when administered later than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, by causing cardiovascular depression. Unless future RCTs provide evidence of treatment effect, clinicians should not routinely use intravenous N-acetylcysteine in SIRS or sepsis and academics should not promote its use.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics in patients with severe sepsis.	VNCH8M	N-acetylcysteine may reduce the risk of acute renal failure and mortality in patients with moderate to severe acute sepsis. However, the evidence is limited and the results should be interpreted with caution.	A	
CD000246	This review fails to demonstrate a clear overall benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment for preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. This treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. Further research may be justified (when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available) in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture, and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective. [Note: The 17 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	SPNXTA	Antibiotic treatment is associated with a reduction in the rate of preterm birth, a reduction of suspected sepsis, and an increased rate of NICU admission. However, there is no evidence of a benefit on other important maternal and neonatal outcomes. Further research is required to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen for women with threatened idiopathic preterm labour.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of antibiotics to prolong pregnancy in women with preterm labour.

CD008012	Psychological interventions and pharmacological interventions with SSRIs may have a small yet clinically meaningful effect on depression outcomes in CAD patients. No beneficial effects on the reduction of mortality rates and cardiac events were found.

CD006033	Whether steroidal contraceptives influence fracture risk cannot be determined from existing information. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses to follow up. Health care providers and women should consider the costs and benefits of these effective contraceptives. For example, injectable contraceptives and implants provide effective, long-term birth control yet do not involve a daily regimen. Progestin-only contraceptives are considered appropriate for women who should avoid estrogen due to medical conditions.	AQ85CE	The combined oral contraceptive combined with progestogens appears to have a small but statistically significant effect on bone mineral density compared to the combined oral contraceptives alone. The effect of combined oral contraception on bone density is small and probably of limited clinical importance. The combined oral and vaginal contraceptives are effective in preventing osteoporosis.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular oral contraceptive method for the prevention of pregnancy in women aged 20 to 35 years.	A

CD006122	The available evidence suggests that use of high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat enteral feeds in patients with at least 10% TBSA burns might reduce the incidence of pneumonia compared with use of a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet. The available evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect of either enteral feeding regimen on mortality. Note that the available evidence is limited to two small studies judged to be of moderate risk of bias. Further research is needed in this area before strong conclusions can be drawn.

CD005137	In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.	8FWF5T	pharmacologic interventions for amblyopia are effective in improving visual acuity and improving contrast sensitivity. The is no evidence that patching is more effective than placebo or glasses in treating severe amblyopia. The is no evidence that patching is more effective than placebo or glasses in treating mild amblyopia.	VNCH8M	Patching is effective in improving visual acuity in children aged 3 to 17 years. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend full-time patching for treating moderate to severe amblyopia.	A

CD007066	Aliskiren has a dose-related blood pressure lowering effect better than placebo. This effect is similar to that determined for ACE inhibitors and ARBs.	SPNXTA	Direct renin inhibitor aliskiren reduces BP more than HCTZ, and more than hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan. However, there is no evidence to support its use as a first-line treatment in patients with hypertension.	8FWF5T	There is some evidence that aliskiren 300 mg is superior to placebo in lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The data are based on a single study and therefore we can not draw any conclusions about the relative efficacy of aliskiren 300 mg versus placebo.	B	
CD002265	This systematic review found one randomised controlled trial with a small number of patients in the different clinical subgroups of neurological manifestation. There is very low-quality evidence that cyclophosphamide is more effective in reducing symptoms of neuropsychiatric involvement in SLE compared with methylprednisolone. However, properly designed randomised controlled trials that involve large numbers of individuals, with explicit clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria, sufficient duration of follow-up and description of all relevant outcome measures, are necessary to guide practice. As we did not find any new trials to include in this review at update, the conclusions of the review did not change.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether cyclophosphamide is more effective than MP in the treatment of NPSLE.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of SLE. The available evidence suggests that corticolic steroids may be effective in reducing the number of seizures and improving muscle strength and disability in patients with SLE, but the quality of the evidence is poor. There is a need for further well-designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal dose and duration of cortical steroids in the management of Sle.	A	
CD000220	Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes.

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether infants with cardiovascular compromise benefit from volume expansion. There is insufficient evidence to determine what type of volume expansion should be used in preterm infants (if at all) or to determine the benefit of using early red cell transfusions. The significance of the finding of a significant increase in blood pressure in hypotensive preterm infants in one trial comparing albumin and saline is unclear, but the overall meta-analyses found no other significant clinical benefit in using albumin compared to saline.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of albumin for the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants.

CD008012	Psychological interventions and pharmacological interventions with SSRIs may have a small yet clinically meaningful effect on depression outcomes in CAD patients. No beneficial effects on the reduction of mortality rates and cardiac events were found. Overall, however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of high quality trials per outcome and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions.

CD003412	Overall there has been very little good quality research on treatments for BCC. Most trials have only evaluated BCCs in low risk locations. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments with surgery showing the lowest failure rates. Although cosmetic outcomes appear good with PDT, long-term follow-up data are needed. Other treatments might have some use but few have been compared to surgery.

CD004829	The evidence from this review of 21 randomised controlled trials did not support one particular method or technique over another in providing effective conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during and after oocyte recovery. The simultaneous use of more than one method of sedation and pain relief resulted in better pain relief than one modality alone. The various approaches and techniques reviewed appeared to be acceptable and were associated with a high degree of satisfaction in women. As women vary in their experience of pain and in coping strategies, the optimal method may be individualised depending on the preferences of both the women and the clinicians and resource availability.	AQ85CE	Isodesox is an effective sedative for women undergoing surgery. It is associated with fewer adverse effects than midazolam and is associated less nausea and vomiting.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence to support the use of any specific analgesic technique during oocyte retrieval.	B	
CD000143	Implications for practice: nasal CPAP is effective in preventing failure of extubation in preterm infants following a period of endotracheal intubation and IPPV.

CD005522	Tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol decreases pain intensity, produces symptom relief and improves function, but these benefits are small. Adverse events, although reversible and not life threatening, often cause participants to stop taking the medication and could limit tramadol or tramadol plus paracetamol usefulness.	VNCH8M	Tramadol is an effective analgesic for moderate to severe OA. Its adverse effects are similar to those of other NSAIDs.

CD009190	We found only one RCT, with a moderate risk of bias, which showed that providing PEP support by phone calls did not result in higher adherence to PEP. However, the RCT was conducted in an upper-middle-income country with high HIV prevalence, on a high-risk population and the applicability of its results on other settings and contexts is unclear.

CD008870	Sulfasalazine has modest efficacy compared to placebo and is inferior to corticosteroids for the treatment of mild to moderately active Crohn's disease. Olsalazine and low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) are not superior to placebo. High dose mesalamine (3 to 4.5 g/day) is not more effective than placebo for inducing response or remission. High dose mesalamine was inferior to budesonide for inducing remission in a single trial. In conclusion, sulfasalazine shows modest efficacy for the treatment of active Crohn's disease.

CD003212	Implications for practice: NIPPV is a useful method of augmenting the beneficial effects of NCPAP in preterm infants. Its use reduces the incidence of symptoms of extubation failure more effectively than NCPAP. Within the limits of the small numbers of infants randomised to NIPPV there is a reassuring absence of the gastrointestinal side effects that were reported in previous case series. Implications for research: Future trials should enroll a sufficient number of infants to detect differences in important outcomes such as chronic lung disease and gastrointestinal perforation.

When used at 8, 12 or 20mg/day it appears to be as acceptable as placebo (in terms of various adverse events including movement disorders and somnolence), but seems to be associated with more cardiac problems (8, 12 or 20mg/day) and an increase in weight gain (20mg/day) than placebo. Sertindole at a dose of 24mg/day was better tolerated than haloperidol (in terms of participants leaving the study early). It was also found to be was associated with fewer movement disorders (at 8, 16, 20 or 24mg/day) and sedation (8 or 24mg/day) than haloperidol. However, it was shown to cause more cardiac anomalies (16, 20 or 24mg/day), weight gain (all doses combined), rhinitis (16 or 24mg/day), and problems with sexual functioning (24mg/day) than haloperidol. One short term study reported that sertindole 16mg/day was the most optimal dose.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of sertindole for the treatment of schizophrenia.	SPNXTA	Sertindole is an effective treatment for the short term treatment of schizophrenia. It is associated with less extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol, but with fewer motor impairments.	B	
CD004950	If available, breastfeeding or breast milk should be used to alleviate procedural pain in neonates undergoing a single painful procedure rather than placebo, positioning or no intervention. Administration of glucose/sucrose had similar effectiveness as breastfeeding for reducing pain. The effectiveness of breast milk for painful procedure should be studied in the preterm population, as there are currently a limited number of studies in the literature that have assessed it's effectiveness in this population.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of lactation support for the prevention of pain during blood sampling in term infants. Further research is needed to determine whether lactation supports the prevention or treatment of pain in term newborn infants.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of sucrose for the prevention of pain during blood sampling. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of sucrose for the prevention of pain during breastfeeding. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of sucrose for the prevention of pain during venipuncture.	A	
CD000255	There were no randomised trials comparing either anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs with control, thus there is no evidence to support their routine use for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. There were also no randomised trials that directly compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet drugs and the reported non-randomised studies did not show any evidence of a significant difference between the two.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the role of anticoagulation in the treatment of spontaneous carotid dissection.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific method of diagnosis for carotid artery dissection. The results of this review suggest that there is no reliable evidence to guide clinical practice.	B	
CD002964	Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence to suggest that culturally sensitive videotape may be beneficial for improving parent-infant interaction. However, the evidence is too limited to draw any conclusions. Further research is needed to assess the effects of culturally insensitive videotape on infant and social functioning.	AQ85CE	The review provides some evidence that parenting interventions can improve the quality of life of adolescent mothers and their infants. However, the evidence is limited and the results are heterogeneous. The review highlights the need for more research to be conducted in this area.	B	
CD004998	The small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. Transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation. Drop out rates appear to be high, and adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of meditation for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine the role of meditation in the treatment of anxiety.	B	anxiety > obsessive-compulsive disorder
CD001112	Caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly, for up to four hours, in people with asthma. People may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing, as caffeine ingestion could cause misinterpretation of the results. Drinking caffeinated coffee before taking exhaled nitric oxide measurements does not appear to affect the results of the test, but more studies are needed to confirm this.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of caffeine for bronchodilator purposes in adults.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of caffeine in the treatment of asthma. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of caffeine in the treatment of asthma.	B	
CD003427	Prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous sickle cell disease, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the two included trials is insufficient to determine whether the use of pneumococcal vaccine in children with sickle cell disease prevents the development of serotype-specific IgG antibodies. The use of vaccine in this population is associated with a reduction in the risk of severe adverse events.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of oral penicillin in preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell anemia.	A	the conclusion about adverse reaction is at least relevant
CD007289	P-Chem may reduce the risk of progression to GTN in women with CMs who are at a high risk of malignant transformation; however, current evidence in favour of P-Chem is limited by the poor methodological quality and small size of the included studies. As P-Chem may increase drug resistance, delay treatment of GTN and expose women unnecessarily to toxic side effects, this practice cannot currently be recommended.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chemotherapy for patients with complete hydatidiform mole.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of prophylactic chemotherapy for the treatment of CHM.	B	
CD003231	The data from the present meta-analysis indicate that tumour recurrence was significantly reduced with intravesical BCG compared to MMC only in the subgroup of patients at high risk of tumour recurrence. However, there was no difference in terms of disease progression or survival, and the decision to use either agent might be based on adverse events and cost.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any particular type of intravesical chemotherapy for bladder cancer.	AQ85CE	The use of BCG in patients with superficial bladder cancer reduces the risk of recurrence and progression, but the benefit is small. The optimal BCG regimen remains unclear.	B	
CD003937	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of herbal medicines in HIV-infected individuals and AIDS patients. Potential beneficial effects need to be confirmed in large, rigorous trials.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of Chinese medicinal herbs for the management of diarrhoea.	AQ85CE	Chinese medicinal herbs may be effective in treating HIV-related symptoms and improving quality of life in HIV-infected people. However, the evidence is limited. The trials included in this review were small, of short duration and of poor quality. The results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and the small sample size. Further research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of Chinese medicinal herbs in treating symptoms and to assess their role in preventing or controlling HIV-induced illness.	B	
CD002896	VNS for partial seizures appears to be an effective and well tolerated treatment. Adverse effects of hoarseness, cough, pain, paresthesias, and dyspnea are associated with the treatment but appear to be reasonably well tolerated as dropouts were rare. Typical central nervous system adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs such as ataxia, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and somnolence were not statistically significantly associated with VNS treatment.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of high-frequency VNS stimulation in the treatment of epilepsy.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether Vagus nerve stimulation is an effective treatment for epilepsy. Further trials are needed.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD006907	For pregnant women with non-severe pre-existing or non-proteinuric gestational hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to determine how tight control of hypertension should be achieved to improve maternal and fetal-neonatal outcomes.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of tight versus tight control of blood pressure control in pregnancy.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of a 'tight' or 'tweaked' control of pre-existing or gestational hypertension. Further research is needed.	B	
CD008871	Low-dose rate brachytherapy did not reduce biochemical recurrence-free survival versus radical prostatectomy at 5 years. For short-term severe adverse events, low-dose rate brachytherapy was significantly more favorable for urinary incontinence, but radical prostatectomy was significantly more favorable for urinary irritation. Evidence is based on one RCT with high risk of bias.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether radical retropubic prostatectomy is superior to brachytherapy for the treatment of low-risk CaP.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether or not brachytherapy is superior to RRP in the treatment of low-risk prostate cancer.	B	
CD008586	There is a lack of robust, randomised, controlled evidence to support the choice of antiepileptic drug for the treatment of seizures in adults with brain tumours. While some authors support the use of non enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, reliable, comparative evidence to provide clinical justification for this is limited. There is a need for further large, randomised, controlled trials in this area.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of phenytoin as a monotherapy for the treatment of tumor-related seizures in patients with cancer.	AQ85CE	Levetiracetam is a relatively safe and well tolerated monotherapy drug for the treatment of patients with glioma-related seizures. Its use is associated with a lower risk of adverse events than phenytoin, but a higher risk of serious adverse events.	A	
CD006904	There is some evidence of a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, weaning duration and ICU LOS with use of standardized protocols, but there is significant heterogeneity among studies and an insufficient number of studies to investigate the source of this heterogeneity. Although some study authors suggest that organizational context may influence outcomes, these factors were not considered in all included studies and therefore could not be evaluated.	SPNXTA	There is evidence that weaning patients from mechanical ventilation reduces the risk of reintubation, the length of hospital stay, and the rate of successful extubation. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any of the interventions.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of a single intervention for mechanical ventilation in patients with severe cardiac disease. Further research is required.	B	
CD003794	Compared with placebo, combination therapy led to a significant reduction of a quarter in exacerbation rates. There was a significant reduction in all-cause mortality with the addition of data from the TORCH trial. The increased risk of pneumonia is a concern, and better reporting of this outcome in future studies would be helpful. In order to draw firmer conclusions about the effects of combination therapy in a single inhaler more data are necessary, particularly in relation to the profile of adverse events and benefits in relation to different doses of inhaled corticosteroids.	SPNXTA	In the short-term, inhaled corticosteroids given in combination with salmeterol significantly improved FEV1 compared with placebo, and significantly reduced the number of exacerbations per year. However, there was a significant increase in oral candidiasis.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD.		
CD010611	Valproate is effective in reducing headache frequency and is reasonably well tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that ELS is effective in reducing pain intensity and frequency of attacks in patients with migraine headaches. However, the number of patients studied is small and the number included in the analysis is heterogeneous. The number of participants studied is too small to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of ELS compared with placebo.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproate as a prophylactic agent for migraine.		
CD003071	Epidural analgesia may be useful for postoperative pain relief following major lower limb joint replacements. However, the benefits may be limited to the early (four to six hours) postoperative period. An epidural infusion of local anaesthetic or local anaesthetic-narcotic mixture may be better than epidural narcotic alone. The magnitude of pain relief must be weighed against the frequency of adverse events. The current evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions on the frequency of rare complications from epidural analgesia, postoperative morbidity or mortality, functional outcomes, or length of hospital stay.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of continuous epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief.	VNCH8M	Epidural analgesia is effective in reducing pain and the need for additional analgesia in patients undergoing surgery for hip replacement. However, it does not reduce the need for additional analgesia in patients undergoing surgery for hip replacement.		
CD002265	This systematic review found one randomised controlled trial with a small number of patients in the different clinical subgroups of neurological manifestation. There is very low-quality evidence that cyclophosphamide is more effective in reducing symptoms of neuropsychiatric involvement in SLE compared with methylprednisolone. However, properly designed randomised controlled trials that involve large numbers of individuals, with explicit clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria, sufficient duration of follow-up and description of all relevant outcome measures, are necessary to guide practice. As we did not find any new trials to include in this review at update, the conclusions of the review did not change.	JB6Z8F	Cyclophosphamide is more effective than MP in the treatment of acute, severe NPSLE.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to determine which drug is the most effective in the treatment of NPSLE. There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of different drugs in the management of NPP. Such trials should be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org/).		
CD001055	Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy reduce the proportion of women who continue to smoke in late pregnancy, and reduce low birthweight and preterm birth. Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy need to be implemented in all maternity care settings. Given the difficulty many pregnant women addicted to tobacco have quitting during pregnancy, population-based measures to reduce smoking and social inequalities should be supported.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that there is no evidence to support the use of antenatal smoking cessation interventions to improve smoking cessation rates among pregnant women. There is a need for further research to determine whether antenatal interventions are effective and cost-effective.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antenatal smoking cessation interventions to reduce smoking during pregnancy.		
CD007066	Aliskiren has a dose-related blood pressure lowering effect better than placebo. This effect is similar to that determined for ACE inhibitors and ARBs.	VNCH8M	Aliskiren is an effective first-line treatment for moderate to severe hypertension. Aliskiren is associated with a higher rate of discontinuation than placebo.	SPNXTA	Direct renin inhibitor aliskiren reduces BP more than HCTZ, and more than hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan. However, there is no evidence to support its use as a first-line treatment in patients with hypertension.		
CD008120	We identified eligible trials on quetiapine, risperidone and olanzapine. The available data on olanzapine and risperidone are too limited to draw any conclusions. Monotherapy with quetiapine seems to be efficacious in reducing symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder and this effect may be similar to that of antidepressants. However, quetiapine's efficacy must be weighed against its lower tolerability.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of quetiapine as a treatment for GAD.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of quetiapine as an adjunctive treatment for patients with generalized anxiety disorder. The results suggest that quetiapine may be more effective than placebo in the short-term. The results of this review suggest that quetiapine may be more effective than placebo in the long-term.		
CD000369	Interferon alfa is effective in improving biochemical outcomes and achieving sustained virologic clearance in patients with transfusion-acquired acute hepatitis C. The effect on long-term clinical outcomes could not be assessed due to limitations in the current data.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of interferon for the treatment of acute hepatitis C.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of interferon in the treatment of acute hepatitis C.		
CD003916	EBRT reduces the risk of locoregional recurrence but has no significant impact on cancer-related deaths or overall survival. It is associated with significant morbidity and a reduction in quality of life. There is no demonstrable survival advantage from adjuvant EBRT for high-risk stage I endometrial cancer, however, the meta-analyses of this subgroup were underpowered and also included high-intermediate risk women, therefore we cannot exclude a small benefit in the high-risk subgroup. EBRT may have an adverse effect on endometrial cancer survival when used to treat uncomplicated low-risk (IA/B grade 1/2) endometrial cancer. For the intermediate to high-intermediate risk group, VBT alone appears to be adequate in ensuring vaginal control compared to EBRT. Further research is needed to guide practice for lesions that are truly high risk. In addition, the definitions of risk should be standardised.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of pelvic radiotherapy in the treatment of women with stage I endometrial carcinoma.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of postoperative pelvic radiotherapy for women with stage I endometrial carcinoma.		
CD007872	Tranexamic acid decreases postpartum blood loss after vaginal birth and after caesarean section based on two RCTs of unclear quality which reported on only a few outcomes. Further investigations are needed to confirm efficacy and safety of this regimen for preventing PPH. These results also provide a basis for the investigation of tranexamic acid for the treatment of PPH.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tranexamic acid to reduce postpartum blood loss after caesarian section.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of tranexamic acid for the treatment of postpartum bleeding. Further research is needed.		
CD006168	Despite some positive results shown in the included trials, there is insufficient evidence that biofeedback is effective for the management of pain during labour.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of biofeedback for pain management during labour.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of biofeedback for the management of pain during labour. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of biofeedback for the management of pain during labour. The research is needed to determine whether biofeedback is effective for the management of pain during labour.		
CD008493	Preoperative statin therapy reduces the odds of post-operative AF and shortens the stay on the ICU and in the hospital. Statin pretreatment had no influence on perioperative mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction or renal failure. Since analysed studies included mainly patients undergoing myocardial revascularizations the results cannot be extrapolated to patients undergoing other cardiac procedures such as heart valve or aortic surgery.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of statins for the prevention of postoperative AF in patients undergoing elective CABG.	PX7SGV	The available evidence does not support the routine use of statins in the treatment of patients with cardiopulmonary bypass. There is a need for further well-designed randomised controlled trials.		
CD003770	Though recurrence in the remaining liver happened less in the hepatic artery chemotherapy group, overall survival was not improved, and even favoured the control group, though not significantly. This added intervention cannot be recommended at this time.	SPNXTA	Based on the results of the two included RCTs, there is no evidence to support the routine use of HAI to prevent recurrence of liver metastases in patients with liver resection or metastatic colorectal cancer.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of adjuvant hepatic arterial chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer.		
CD002255	When tocolysis is indicated for women in preterm labour, calcium channel blockers are preferable to other tocolytic agents compared, mainly betamimetics. Further research should address the effects of different dosage regimens and formulations of calcium channel blockers on maternal and neonatal outcomes. [Note: The 39 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any calcium antagonists in the management of preterm labor. The is insufficient evidence to determine whether calcium antagonists are more effective than placebo or to determine whether they are more effective than other agents. The is insufficient evidence to determine whether calcium antagonists are more effective than placebo or to determine whether they are more effective than other agents.	SPNXTA	Corticosteroids are an effective tocolytic agent for the treatment of threatened preterm labour. Nifedipine and ritodrine have not been rigorously evaluated for their role in preventing preterm birth.		
CD006746	There is currently no strong evidence for laser peripheral iridoplasty’s use in treating angle-closure.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether peripheral iridotomy is superior to iridoplasty in the treatment of primary angle-closure glaucoma.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of laser peripheral iridotomy in the treatment of primary angle-closure glaucoma.		
CD006866	Oral acyclovir did not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether other antiviral treatments prevent PHN. Additional well-designed, randomised controlled trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents, with a greater number of participants are needed. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.	AQ85CE	Acyclovir appears to be effective in preventing or treating herpes zoster ophthalmicus. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of trials and the small sample sizes. The evidence for the efficacy of acyclovir in preventing and treating herpes Zoster ocularus is weak and inconclusive.	PX7SGV	Thereral acyclovir appears to be effective in the treatment of acute herpes zoster. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support its use in clinical practice.		
CD006168	Despite some positive results shown in the included trials, there is insufficient evidence that biofeedback is effective for the management of pain during labour.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of EMG biofeedback for women in labour. Further research is needed.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of biofeedback for pain management during labour.		
CD007345	Prophylactic antibiotics reduce bacteriaemia and seem to prevent cholangitis and septicaemia in patients undergoing elective ERCP. In the subgroup of patients with uncomplicated ERCP, the effect of antibiotics may be less evident. Further research is required to determine whether antibiotics can be given during or after an ERCP if it becomes apparent that biliary obstruction cannot be relieved during that procedure.	SPNXTA	Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces the risk of pancreatitis after ERCP, but the absolute risk is not significant.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of post-operative cholangitis or pancreatitis. The evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the included studies. The is no evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of post-operative sepsis or acute pancreatitis. The evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of antibiotics for biliary tract obstruction.		
CD001539	The provision of recordings or summaries of key consultations may benefit most adults with cancer. Although more research is needed to improve our understanding of these interventions, most patients find them very useful. Practitioners should consider offering people recordings or written summaries of their consultations	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of audio-visual interventions in the management of patients with cancer.	SPNXTA	There is limited evidence to support the use of audio-taped consultations to enhance the recall of patients and their clinicians regarding clinical information. There is some evidence that tapes may be more effective than standardised consultations in improving recall of information given in a clinical trial. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the widespread use of tapes in clinical practice.		
CD000024	Since the last version of the review, neither of the two new relevant studies have provided additional information to change the conclusions. In patients with acute ischaemic stroke, immediate anticoagulant therapy is not associated with net short or long-term benefit. Treatment with anticoagulants reduced recurrent stroke, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, but increased bleeding risk. The data do not support the routine use of any the currently available anticoagulants in acute ischaemic stroke.	AQ85CE	Antiplatelet therapy with LMWH is effective in reducing the risk of major bleeding and major thrombotic complications in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of patients studied and the small sample size of the included trials. Further trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of LMWH in acute ischemic stroke.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of heparin in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.		
CD003212	Implications for practice: NIPPV is a useful method of augmenting the beneficial effects of NCPAP in preterm infants. Its use reduces the incidence of symptoms of extubation failure more effectively than NCPAP. Within the limits of the small numbers of infants randomised to NIPPV there is a reassuring absence of the gastrointestinal side effects that were reported in previous case series. Implications for research: Future trials should enroll a sufficient number of infants to detect differences in important outcomes such as chronic lung disease and gastrointestinal perforation. The impact of synchronisation of NIPPV on the technique's safety and efficacy should be established in future trials.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of SNIPPV for extubation of preterm infants.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of non-invasive ventilation in very low birth weight infants to reduce the risk of extubation.		
CD007414	There is no evidence to suggest that the use of platinum agents, doxorubicin or paclitaxel used as maintenance chemotherapy is more effective than observation alone. Further investigations regarding the effect of paclitaxel used as maintenance chemotherapy are required.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that paclitaxel or platinum-based chemotherapy is superior to other forms of chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic ovarian cancer. The results of this review suggest that paclitaxel is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of progression, but this effect is not statistically significant. The results of this review suggest that paclitaxel is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of progression, but this effect is not statistically significant.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of consolidation chemotherapy for women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.		
CD006616	Overall, this meta-analysis puts doubt on the safety and utility of intravenous N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy in SIRS and sepsis. At best, N-acetylcysteine is ineffective in reducing mortality and complications in this patient population. At worst, it can be harmful, especially when administered later than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, by causing cardiovascular depression. Unless future RCTs provide evidence of treatment effect, clinicians should not routinely use intravenous N-acetylcysteine in SIRS or sepsis and academics should not promote its use.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics in patients with severe sepsis.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of N-acetylcysteine as an adjunct to other interventions for the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe acute respiratory failure.		
CD005042	Further research examining the effectiveness of family therapy versus a no-treatment control condition is needed to determine whether family therapy is an effective intervention for children with ADHD. There were no results available from studies investigating forms of family therapy other than behavioural family therapy.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of combination therapy for ADHD.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychostimulants in the management of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

CD007345	Prophylactic antibiotics reduce bacteriaemia and seem to prevent cholangitis and septicaemia in patients undergoing elective ERCP. In the subgroup of patients with uncomplicated ERCP, the effect of antibiotics may be less evident. Further research is required to determine whether antibiotics can be given during or after an ERCP if it becomes apparent that biliary obstruction cannot be relieved during that procedure.	AQ85CE	Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the risk of ERCP-induced cholangitis and the need for further surgery in patients with ERCCP-induced complications.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis before ERCP.		
CD002781	Topical fluorides (mouthrinses, gels, or varnishes) used in addition to fluoride toothpaste achieve a modest reduction in caries compared to toothpaste used alone. No conclusions about any adverse effects could be reached, because data were scarcely reported in the trials.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of fluoride toothpastes for preventing dental caries.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the included studies was limited. There was no evidence of a significant difference in the rate of caries between fluoride toothpastes and mouthrinse, and no evidence that fluoride toothpaste was more effective than mouthrines. There is a need for further well-designed, adequately powered, adequately reported, randomised controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of fluoride toothpaint versus mouthrinets for preventing caries.		
CD000220	Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes. The cure rate could probably be higher if more partners used the treatment.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of metronidazole for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis in preterm women. The results of this review suggest that metronidazole may be beneficial for the prevention of vaginal candidiasis in preterm women.	SPNXTA	Treatment of asymptomatic trichomoniasis with metronidazole 48 hours or 48 hours apart does not prevent preterm birth in women with trichomiasis. However, it does reduce the risk of caesarean section and the time of birth. [Note: The four citations in the awaiting classification section may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]		
CD007979	As only one study was identified for inclusion, the results are inadequate to inform clinical practice in regard to the use of email for clinical communication between healthcare professionals. Future research needs to use high-quality study designs that take advantage of the most recent developments in information technology, with consideration of the complexity of email as an intervention, and costs.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of interventions to prevent fractures in post-menopausal women. The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the effectiveness of interventions to prevent fractures in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.

No conclusions about any adverse effects could be reached, because data were scarcely reported in the trials.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of fluoride mouthrinses for the prevention of dental caries in children. The results of this review suggest that fluoride mouthrinses may be effective in the prevention of dental caries in children. The is a need for well-designed, high-quality, randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of mouthrinses for the prevention of dental caries in children.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the included studies was limited. There was no evidence of a significant difference in the rate of caries between fluoride toothpastes and mouthrinse, and no evidence that fluoride toothpaste was more effective than mouthrines. There is a need for further well-designed, adequately powered, adequately reported, randomised controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of fluoride toothpaint versus mouthrinets for preventing caries.		
CD005944	The lack of effect on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, with exception of some improved infant morbidity in one small study, and the improvement in maternal vitamin A status, suggest that maternal postpartum vitamin A supplementation offers limited benefits.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine supplementation of mothers with vitamin A to prevent or reduce infant mortality.	AQ85CE	VAS supplementation to mothers after childbirth reduces the risk of neonatal mortality and morbidity in infants born to mothers who are not receiving adequate vitamin A. The effect of VAS supplementation on the risk for neonatal death and morbidities in infants who are receiving VAS is unclear.		
CD002855	Safe and effective medical abortion methods are available. Combined regimens are more effective than single agents. In the combined regimen, the dose of mifepristone can be lowered to 200 mg without significantly decreasing the method effectiveness. Vaginal misoprostol is more effective than oral administration, and has less side effects than sublingual or buccal. Some results are limited by the small numbers of participants on which they are based. Almost all trials were conducted in settings with good access to emergency services, which may limit the generalizability of these results.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of misoprostol for early medical abortion. The is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of misoprostol for early medical abortion.	SPNXTA	Vaginal misoprostol is an effective method of medical abortion in early pregnancy. It is less effective than mifepristone or mifecristone, or at the same dose, and is associated with higher rates of incomplete abortion.

CD000246	This review fails to demonstrate a clear overall benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment for preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. This treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. Further research may be justified (when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available) in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture, and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective. [Note: The 17 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antibiotics for women with intact membranes. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a benefit in terms of preterm birth, or whether there is a reduction in neonatal morbidity.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of antibiotics in women with intact membranes for preterm birth. Further research is needed.		
CD004878	Current evidence does not support a clinically relevant effect of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids on admissions or length of hospitalisation. Combined dexamethasone and epinephrine may reduce outpatient admissions, but results are exploratory and safety data limited. Future research should further assess the efficacy, harms and applicability of combined therapy.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of children with bronchiolitis. The use of corticosteroids in children with bronchiolitis is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission. The use of corticosteroids in children with bronchiolitis is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission.	VNCH8M	Corticosteroids are effective in the short-term in reducing hospital admission and duration of oxygen therapy in children with acute bronchiolitis. However, the long-term effects of corticosteroids on mortality and hospital stay are not known.		
CD008449	The results indicate evidence for the effectiveness of mirror therapy for improving upper extremity motor function, activities of daily living and pain, at least as an adjunct to normal rehabilitation for patients after stroke. Limitations are due to small sample sizes of most included studies, control interventions that are not used routinely in stroke rehabilitation and some methodological limitations of the studies.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of mirror therapy for improving hand function in stroke patients. Further research is needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of mirror therapy for improving hand function in stroke patients.		
CD006229	Laparoscopic and small-incision cholecystectomy seem to be equivalent. No differences could be observed in mortality, complications, and postoperative recovery. Small-incision cholecystectomy has a significantly shorter operative time. Complications in elective cholecystectomy are prevalent.	PX7SGV	There laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a lower rate of postoperative complications. However, there is not enough evidence to support or refute the use of this procedure.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone disease.		
CD007872	Tranexamic acid decreases postpartum blood loss after vaginal birth and after caesarean section based on two RCTs of unclear quality which reported on only a few outcomes. Further investigations are needed to confirm efficacy and safety of this regimen for preventing PPH. These results also provide a basis for the investigation of tranexamic acid for the treatment of PPH.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that tranexamic acid is effective in reducing blood loss in postpartum women. The results of the included studies are based on small numbers of women and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution.	AQ85CE	Treatment with tranexamic acid immediately before caesarean section reduces the risk of postpartum haemorrhage and the need for transfusion.		
CD003659	There is some evidence that face washing combined with topical tetracycline can be effective in reducing severe trachoma and in increasing the prevalence of clean faces. Current evidence does not however support a beneficial effect of face washing alone or in combination with topical tetracycline in reducing active trachoma.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of face -washing as a treatment for trachoma.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of face-washing as an intervention for improving trachoma prevention in children.		
CD009192	We found only one eligible study. Although this study showed the use of the telephone for HIV test results notification was more effective than face-to-face delivery, it had a high-risk of bias. The study was conducted about 13 years ago in a high-income country, on a high-risk population, with low HIV prevalence, and the applicability of its results to other settings and contexts is unclear. The study did not provide information about telephone HIV test results notification of HIV positive people since none of the intervention group participants were HIV positive. We found no information about the acceptability of the intervention to patients’ and providers’, its economic outcomes or potential adverse effects. There is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of telephone use for HIV test results notification.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of telephone notification for HIV testing in youth.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of telephone notification for HIV testing of HIV positive youth.		
CD005137	In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.	AQ85CE	The limited evidence available suggests that 2 hours of daily photocoagulation is more effective than 6 hours of continuous photocoage in the treatment of mild amblyopia in children younger than 7 years of age. However, the evidence is based on a small number of small trials with short follow-up periods and is not strong enough to support the routine use of daily patching in this population.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either full or partial patching for the treatment of amblyopia. Further trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment for amblyopia.		
CD003421	These results suggest that calcium channel blockers given in the peri-operative period may reduce the incidence of ATN post-transplantation. The result should be treated with caution due to the heterogeneity of the trials which made comparison of studies and pooling of data difficult.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that immunosuppression may improve the outcome of kidney transplantation recipients. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support or refute the use of immunossuppression in this setting. Calcium channel blockers and verapamil may have a beneficial effect on renal function but the evidence for their beneficial effects is inconclusive. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of calcium channel blocker administration and to compare these with other immunocompressive agents, including calcium channel blockers.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CCB in the treatment of CKD.		
CD007887	Caffeine has shown effectiveness for treating PDPH, decreasing the proportion of participants with PDPH persistence and those requiring supplementary interventions, when compared with placebo. Gabapentin, theophylline and hydrocortisone have also shown a decrease in pain severity scores when compared with placebo or conventional care. There is a lack of conclusive evidence for the other drugs assessed (sumatriptan and ACTH). These conclusions should be interpreted with caution, due to the lack of information to allow correct appraisal of risk of bias, the small sample sizes of studies and also the limited generalisability, as most participants were post-partum women in their 30s.	JB6Z8F	There is currently no evidence to support the use of intravenous hydrocortisone for the treatment of post-dural puncture headache.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of intravenous corticosteroids for the treatment of post-puncture headache.		
CD006133	Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods. We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by body mass index (obese versus normal).	VNCH8M	Lactation may be reduced by reducing the dose of progestogens in the combined oral contraceptive. However, the effect on lipid metabolism is not clear. The effect on blood pressure is not clear. There is no evidence of a difference in lipid metabolism between LNG and DS G. There is no evidence of a difference in blood pressure between LNG and DS G.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine the effects of oral contraceptives on glycosylated hemoglobin A1C and triglyceride levels.		
CD003341	Quinine loading dose reduced fever clearance time and parasite clearance time. Data are insufficient to directly demonstrate an impact of loading dose on risk of death.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence to support or refute the use of intravenous quinine for treatment of severe malaria.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intravenous quinine for the treatment of malaria in children.		
CD004611	There is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy for C. difficile colitis. There is no evidence to support the use of probiotics alone in the treatment of C. difficile colitis.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics in the treatment of patients with recurrent or complicated clostridium difficile infection. The is a need for larger randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of patients with recurrent or complicated clostridium difficile infection.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics for recurrent Clostridium difficile disease.		
CD010257	Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations showed large and consistent beneficial effects across outcomes of patients admitted to an ICU. However, for outpatients and inpatients the results were inconsistent. The risk for treatment failure was significantly reduced in both inpatients and outpatients when all trials (1957 to 2012) were included but not when the analysis for outpatients was restricted to currently used antibiotics. Also, antibiotics had no statistically significant effect on mortality and length of hospital stay in inpatients and almost no data on patient-reported outcomes exist. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that help identify patients who benefit from antibiotics and patients who experience no effect, and in whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs and multi-resistance) could be avoided.	PX7SGV	Theibiotic therapy appears to be effective in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics in this population. Further research is needed.	SPNXTA	Antibiotic treatment is effective in reducing the number of exacerbations and the time to resolution of symptoms in patients with mild to moderate COPD. However, the magnitude of the treatment effect is small and the clinical significance is unclear. Antibiotic therapy should not be used in the routine management of patients with COPD who have an exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation.		
CD008288	Although there were significant glucose-lowering effects with the use of some herbal mixtures, due to methodological deficiencies and small sample sizes we are unable to draw any definite conclusions regarding their efficacy. Though no significant adverse events were reported, there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend the use of these interventions in routine clinical practice and further studies are needed.	SPNXTA	There is currently insufficient evidence from RCTs to support or refute the use of herbal medicines for type 2 diabetes mellitus.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of herbal medicines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.		
CD005542	There is little evidence to support the use of one particular form of insulin administration over another for pregnant women with diabetes. The data are few, there are only a small number of trials appropriate for meta-analysis, a small number of women included and questionable generalisability of the trial population. Conclusions cannot be made from the available data. Well-designed randomised trials are needed. These trials should be adequately powered to assess the effect of CSII versus MDI on important outcomes for women with diabetes and their infants.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether enhanced insulin therapy is superior or inferior to other forms of insulin therapy for pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. Further trials are needed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of enhanced insulin and micropump therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

CD000246	This review fails to demonstrate a clear overall benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment for preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. This treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. Further research may be justified (when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available) in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture, and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective.

CD003032	Although ethosuximide, lamotrigine and valproate are commonly used to treat people with absence seizures we have insufficient evidence to inform clinical practice, and the few trials included in this review were of poor methodological quality and did not have sufficient number of participants. More trials of better quality are needed.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of melatonin for the treatment of epilepsy in children.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of melatonin for the treatment of absence seizures in children and adolescents.		
CD003581	There is no evidence, either supporting or refuting the use of bed rest at home or in hospital, to prevent preterm birth. Although bed rest in hospital or at home is widely used as the first step of treatment, there is no evidence that this practice could be beneficial. Due to the potential adverse effects that bed rest could have on women and their families, and the increased costs for the healthcare system, clinicians should not routinely advise women to rest in bed to prevent preterm birth. Potential benefits and harms should be discussed with women facing an increased risk of preterm birth. Appropriate research is mandatory. Future trials should evaluate both the effectiveness of bed rest, and the effectiveness of the prescription of bed rest, to prevent preterm birth. [Note: The two citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of preterm birth prevention education in high-risk women.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of preterm birth prevention education and increased clinic visits as primary interventions for reducing preterm birth.		
CD005083	Honey dressings do not increase rates of healing significantly in venous leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression. Honey may delay healing in partial- and full-thickness burns in comparison to early excision and grafting, and in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honey might be superior to some conventional dressing materials, but there is considerable uncertainty about the replicability and applicability of this evidence. There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other types of wounds, and health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressings until sufficient evidence of effect is available.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of honey as a wound dressing for wounds.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of honey for the treatment of acute postoperative wound infections. Further research is needed.		
CD002873	There is no clear benefit of using b2-agonists in the management of recurrent wheeze in the first two years of life although there is conflicting evidence. At present, further studies should only be performed if the patient group can be clearly defined and there is a suitable outcome parameter capable of measuring a response.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of facemasks in the management of wheeze in infants. Further research is needed to determine the role of facembolism in the treatment of wheezing infants.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence that nebulised salbutamol improves wheezy infants' clinical status or airway obstruction. There is evidence that it may reduce the severity of cough and increase functional improvement. There was no evidence of a protective effect of nebulized salbutAMol on wheeze severity.		
CD007986	Overall, there is little evidence that PUFA supplementation provides any benefit for the symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents. The majority of data showed no benefit of PUFA supplementation, although there were some limited data that did show an improvement with combined omega-3 and omega-6 supplementation. It is important that future research addresses current weaknesses in this area, which include small sample sizes, variability of selection criteria, variability of the type and dosage of supplementation, short follow-up times and other methodological weaknesses.	AQ85CE	There is no evidence to support the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of ADHD or hyperactivity.	SPNXTA	There is currently no evidence to support the use of PUFA in children with ADHD. There is a need for further well-designed RCTs with adequate power and long-term follow-up.		
CD002815	Considering the small number of patients examined, the methodological flaws in many of the studies and the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of any given form of physiotherapy over another in Parkinson's disease. Another Cochrane review, Physiotherapy for patients with Parkinson's Disease, found that there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of physiotherapy compared to no physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease.  A wide range of physiotherapy approaches were used in these studies and a survey of UK physiotherapists confirmed that they also use an eclectic combination of techniques in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Plant 1999). Therefore a consensus must be found as to 'best practice' physiotherapy for Parkinson's disease. The efficacy of 'standard' physiotherapy should be proved first before examining variations in physiotherapy methods. Therefore large well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to judge the effect of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. After this large RCTs are needed to demonstrate the most effective form of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients, carers, physiotherapists and physicians should be chosen and the patients monitored for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any effect. The trials should be reported according to CONSORT guidelines (CONSORT 1996).	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of RAS in the rehabilitation of people with Parkinson's disease.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of music-based interventions for people with idiopathic myasthenia gravis. The research should focus on the use of music-based interventions for people with idiopathic myasthenia gravis.		
CD005042	Further research examining the effectiveness of family therapy versus a no-treatment control condition is needed to determine whether family therapy is an effective intervention for children with ADHD. There were no results available from studies investigating forms of family therapy other than behavioural family therapy.	AQ85CE	The available evidence suggests that psychostimulants are effective in treating ADHD in children and adolescents. However, the quality of the evidence is poor. The majority of studies were small and of poor methodological quality. There is a need for more high quality, well-designed, adequately powered, well reported and reported studies.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of combination therapy for ADHD.		
CD005568	Due to the generally low methodological quality and small sample size of the included trials in this systematic review, we could not draw a firm conclusion.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of Erigeron injection in the treatment of patients with acute cerebral infarction.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of Erigeron in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.		
CD005208	There is currently not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the efficacy or safety of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors therapy in acute ischaemic stroke. Results from ongoing trials will help to understand the risk to benefit ratio of these agents.	PX7SGV	Thereciximab appears to be effective in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. However, there is a need for further well-designed randomised controlled trials in this area.	VNCH8M	There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of abciximab for acute ischemic stroke.		
CD003231	The data from the present meta-analysis indicate that tumour recurrence was significantly reduced with intravesical BCG compared to MMC only in the subgroup of patients at high risk of tumour recurrence. However, there was no difference in terms of disease progression or survival, and the decision to use either agent might be based on adverse events and cost.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether intravesical therapy is more or less effective than immunotherapy in the treatment of recurrent bladder cancer. Further well-designed randomised trials are required to answer this question.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any particular type of intravesical chemotherapy for bladder cancer.		
CD000369	Interferon alfa is effective in improving biochemical outcomes and achieving sustained virologic clearance in patients with transfusion-acquired acute hepatitis C.

SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of interferon for the treatment of acute hepatitis C.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon-alpha in acute hepatitis C. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy of interferon-alpha in acute hepatitis C.		
CD001340	A policy of using ECMO in mature infants with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure results in significantly improved survival without increased risk of severe disability. The benefit of ECMO for babies with diaphragmatic hernia is unclear. Further studies are needed to consider the optimal timing for introducing ECMO; to identify which infants are most likely to benefit; and to address the implications of neonatal ECMO during later childhood and adult life.

VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ECMO in neonates with severe respiratory failure.		
CD002783	Thrombolysis appears to offer advantages in terms of reducing post-thrombotic syndrome and maintaining venous patency after DVT. Use of strict eligibility criteria has improved the safety and acceptability of this treatment. The optimum drug, dose and route of administration have yet to be determined.

The evidence is insufficient to support the use of streptokinase in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.		
CD006956	Laparoscopic surgery for small bowel CD may be as safe as the open operation. There was no significant difference in the perioperative outcomes and the long term reoperation rates for disease-related or non-disease related complications of CD.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of laparoscopic ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of ileocolic disease.

VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of Chinese medicinal herbs for the treatment of symptomatic diarrhea in HIV-infected individuals.		
CD006639	Evidence on whether zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence of OM in healthy children under the age of five years living in low- and middle-income countries is mixed. There is some evidence of benefit in children being treated for marasmus (severe malnutrition) but this is based on one small trial and should therefore be treated with caution.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of zinc supplementation in children. Further trials are needed.	AQ85CE	Zinc supplementation in children with persistent diarrhoea significantly reduces the risk of death and morbidity from diarrhoeas. The effect of zinc supplementation on morbidity and growth is modest. The evidence is not strong enough to recommend routine zinc supplementation in the prevention of severe diarrhoeae.		
CD001342	For the secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke after TIA or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that vitamin K antagonists in any dose are not more efficacious than antiplatelet therapy and that medium and high intensity anticoagulation leads to a significant increase in major bleeding complications.	AQ85CE	Oral anticoagulants are effective in preventing vascular events in patients with transient ischaemic stroke and minor ischaemia. However, the evidence is limited. The effect of oral anticoagenics on mortality and major vascular events is unknown.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke in patients with TIA.		
CD002265	This systematic review found one randomised controlled trial with a small number of patients in the different clinical subgroups of neurological manifestation. There is very low-quality evidence that cyclophosphamide is more effective in reducing symptoms of neuropsychiatric involvement in SLE compared with methylprednisolone. However, properly designed randomised controlled trials that involve large numbers of individuals, with explicit clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria, sufficient duration of follow-up and description of all relevant outcome measures, are necessary to guide practice. As we did not find any new trials to include in this review at update, the conclusions of the review did not change.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether cyclophosphamide is more effective than methylprednisolone in the treatment of severe neurological complications in NPSLE.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of SLE. The available evidence suggests that corticolic steroids may be effective in reducing the number of seizures and improving muscle strength and disability in patients with SLE, but the quality of the evidence is poor. There is a need for further well-designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal dose and duration of cortical steroids in the management of Sle.		
CD008493	Preoperative statin therapy reduces the odds of post-operative AF and shortens the stay on the ICU and in the hospital. Statin pretreatment had no influence on perioperative mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction or renal failure. Since analysed studies included mainly patients undergoing myocardial revascularizations the results cannot be extrapolated to patients undergoing other cardiac procedures such as heart valve or aortic surgery.	PX7SGV	The available evidence does not support the routine use of statins in the treatment of patients with cardiopulmonary bypass. There is a need for further well-designed randomised controlled trials.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of preoperative statins in the prevention of postoperative AF in patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting surgery.		
CD006616	Overall, this meta-analysis puts doubt on the safety and utility of intravenous N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy in SIRS and sepsis. At best, N-acetylcysteine is ineffective in reducing mortality and complications in this patient population. At worst, it can be harmful, especially when administered later than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, by causing cardiovascular depression. Unless future RCTs provide evidence of treatment effect, clinicians should not routinely use intravenous N-acetylcysteine in SIRS or sepsis and academics should not promote its use.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence that antioxidant therapy in patients with acute lung injury reduces mortality or morbidity, but there is evidence that it may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of glutathione-acetylcysteine in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis. The evidence is limited, and the results are not consistent. The is insufficient evidence to determine whether glutathione-acetylcysteine is beneficial or harmful in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis.		
CD006866	Oral acyclovir did not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether other antiviral treatments prevent PHN. Additional well-designed, randomised controlled trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents, with a greater number of participants are needed. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.	PX7SGV	Thereral acyclovir appears to be effective in the treatment of acute herpes zoster. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support its use in clinical practice.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster.		
CD002231	Based on one low quality trial, the medicinal herb 'Jianpi Wenshen recipe' may have an antiviral activity in asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B virus. However, rigorous randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed before herbs should be used for this condition.	SPNXTA	The efficacy of Phyllanthus amarus for the treatment of asymptomatic hepatitis B virus carriers remains unclear. The plant appears to be of no benefit in preventing the spread of hepatitis B viruses to other populations.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether Phyllanthus amarus is effective in the eradication of hepatitis B virus.		
CD005237	We know very little of the effects of these drugs regarding service outcomes, general functioning and behaviours, engagement with services and treatment satisfaction from evaluative studies. There was generally a high rate of attrition in the trials and there appears to be little to differentiate between risperidone and olanzapine except on issues of adverse effects. Both drugs are associated with a reduction in psychotic symptoms but both commonly cause unpleasant adverse effects.	AQ85CE	Clozapine may be more effective than placebo in the treatment of schizophrenia, but its adverse effects are similar to those of other atypical drugs. Its adverse effects profile is similar to that of typical antipsychotics, with its tendency to induce weight gain and sedation.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia.

CD005006	We are not able to favour either epirubicin or doxorubicin when given with the same dose. Based on the currently available evidence on heart failure, we conclude that in adults with a solid tumour liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin should be favoured over doxorubicin. For both epirubicin versus doxorubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin no conclusions can be made about the effects of treatment in children treated with anthracyclines and also not in patients diagnosed with leukaemia. More research is needed. For other combinations of anthracycline derivates not enough evidence was available to make definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with anthracyclines.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the two included trials is insufficient to determine whether myocet is superior to conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The results suggest that myocets may be superior to chemotherapy in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival, but the evidence is limited. The data are insufficient to support the use of myocete as a first-line treatment for metastatic Breast Cancer.	SPNXTA	This systematic review found no significant differences between doxorubicin and other anthracyclines for patients with metastatic breast cancer.		
CD006866	Oral acyclovir did not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether other antiviral treatments prevent PHN. Additional well-designed, randomised controlled trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents, with a greater number of participants are needed. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.	VNCH8M	Acyclovir is an effective treatment for herpes zoster. However, the evidence is limited. There is no evidence of benefit for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.	PX7SGV	Thereral acyclovir appears to be effective in the treatment of acute herpes zoster. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support its use in clinical practice.		
CD006853	Based on the evidence, aerobic capacity training combined with muscle strength training is recommended as routine practice in patients with RA.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of exercise for the treatment of RA.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of long-term aerobic exercise for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.		
CD005042	Further research examining the effectiveness of family therapy versus a no-treatment control condition is needed to determine whether family therapy is an effective intervention for children with ADHD. There were no results available from studies investigating forms of family therapy other than behavioural family therapy.	SPNXTA	Based on the available evidence, there is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of combined medication and ADHD medication in children and adolescents with ADHD. However, combined medication appears to have a small beneficial effect on some short-term outcomes, such as school achievement and reading comprehension, and may have a positive effect on behaviour and on school achievement.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of psychostimulants in the treatment of children with ADHD.		
CD001691	Postnatal administration of phenobarbital cannot be recommended as prophylaxis to prevent IVH in preterm infants and is associated with an increased need for mechanical ventilation.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of prophylactic phenobarbital for the prevention of VLBW in preterm infants.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of early anticonvulsant treatment of preterm infants with suspected early (intraventricular haemorrhage) to prevent late (cephalic encephalopathy) or late (neurodevelopmental abnormalities) manifestations of hypoxic-ischemic encomia.		
CD007926	We found insufficient evidence that hormonal treatment in any form, dose or as part of combination therapy improves the survival of patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. However, a large number of patients would be needed to demonstrate an effect on survival and none of the included RCTs had a sufficient number of patients to demonstrate a significant difference. In the absence of a proven survival advantage and the heterogeneity of patient populations, the decision to use any type of hormonal therapy should be individualised and with the intent to palliate the disease. It is debatable whether outcomes such as quality of life, treatment response or palliative measures such as relieving symptoms should take preference over overall and PFS as the major objectives of future trials.	SPNXTA	Progestins are effective in improving survival and progression-free survival in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. However, the quality of the evidence is low. The use of progestins in the treatment of advanced or recurrence disease is not supported by the available evidence. Adjuvant progestagen therapy should be increased to a dose of 200 mg/d.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of progestagen therapy in the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer.		
CD008012	Psychological interventions and pharmacological interventions with SSRIs may have a small yet clinically meaningful effect on depression outcomes in CAD patients. No beneficial effects on the reduction of mortality rates and cardiac events were found. Overall, however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of high quality trials per outcome and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of antidepressants in the treatment of depression in patients with MI.	VNCH8M	SSRIs are effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MI. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether SSRIs are effective in reducing mortality or morbidity in patients with MI.		
CD004317	Most studies to date have shown no benefit of strategies to improve adherence and continuation. These trials have important limitations, however. Three had small sample sizes, four had high losses to follow up, and the intervention and its intensity varied across the studies. High-quality research is a priority, since adherence and continuation are fundamentally important to the successful use of hormonal contraceptives.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of postpartum interventions to increase contraceptive compliance. Further research is needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of post-partum counseling to improve contraceptive use in women aged 14 to 19 years.		
CD006332	Insufficient evidence exists for the safety or efficacy of naloxone or nalbuphine in the treatment of OBD. Long-term efficacy and safety of any of the opioid antagonists is unknown, as is the incidence or nature of rare adverse events. Alvimopan and methylnaltrexone both show promise in treating OBD, but further data will be required to fully assess their place in therapy.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of opioids to reduce the duration of constipation. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of opioids to reduce the duration of constipation.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of peripheral opioid antagonists for the management of gastrointestinal complications. Further research is needed.		
CD006170	The most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. Low cost interventions including early initiation when not feeding at the breast, relaxation, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. Small sample sizes, large standard deviations, small number of studies reviewed, and the diversity of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the specific settings.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether breast milk expressed by breast pumps is better or worse than breast milk obtained by manual expression. There is a need for further research to determine if breast milk derived by breast pump is better than breast pumps obtained by human expression.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of different methods of breast feeding for preterm infants. Further research is needed.		
CD000255	There were no randomised trials comparing either anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs with control, thus there is no evidence to support their routine use for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. There were also no randomised trials that directly compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet drugs and the reported non-randomised studies did not show any evidence of a significant difference between the two.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of anticoagulants in the treatment of patients with cervical artery dissection.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific method of diagnosis for carotid artery dissection. The results of this review suggest that there is no reliable evidence to guide clinical practice.		
CD004998	The small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. Transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation. Drop out rates appear to be high, and adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific psychological interventions for anxiety disorders. There is a need for further well-designed, adequately powered, adequately reported randomised controlled trials.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of meditation for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.		
CD006639	Evidence on whether zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence of OM in healthy children under the age of five years living in low- and middle-income countries is mixed. There is some evidence of benefit in children being treated for marasmus (severe malnutrition) but this is based on one small trial and should therefore be treated with caution.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of zinc supplementation in children. Further trials are needed.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of zinc supplementation to prevent diarrhoea in children under two years of age.		
CD004219	Data from one small study suggest that using a percutaneous central venous catheter to deliver parenteral nutrition improves nutrient input. The significance of this in relation to long-term growth and developmental outcomes is unclear. Three studies suggested that the use of a percutaneous central venous catheter decreases the number of catheters/cannulae needed to deliver the nutrition. No evidence was found to suggest that percutaneous central venous catheter use increased the risk of adverse events, particularly systemic infection.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of peripheral catheters in neonates.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of peripherally inserted catheters for neonatal intensive care. The research is needed to determine whether the use of peripherally inserted catheters is associated with a reduction in the number of infants requiring intravenous therapy.		
CD002962	There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the role of acupuncture to induce labour and for trials to assess clinically meaningful outcomes. [Note: the 15 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture for induction of labour. Further research is needed.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture for induction of labour. The is a need for well-designed, well-powered, high-quality randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for induction of labour.		
CD003713	There is no evidence that pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm is superior to rate control. Rhythm control is associated with more adverse effects and increased hospitalisation. It does not reduce the risk of stroke. The conclusions cannot be generalised to all people with atrial fibrillation. Most of the patients included in these studies were relatively older (>60 years) with significant cardiovascular risk factors.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of either rate control or rhythm control in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.	SPNXTA	The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether rate control is superior to rate control in the management of atrial fibrillation.		
CD003231	The data from the present meta-analysis indicate that tumour recurrence was significantly reduced with intravesical BCG compared to MMC only in the subgroup of patients at high risk of tumour recurrence. However, there was no difference in terms of disease progression or survival, and the decision to use either agent might be based on adverse events and cost.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of immunomodulators in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether immunotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether immunotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer.		
CD003893	Methyldopa lowers blood pressure to varying degrees compared to placebo for patients with primary hypertension. Its effect on clinical outcomes, however, remains uncertain.	SPNXTA	Methyldopa is effective in reducing blood pressure in moderate to high hypertensive patients with moderate to severe hypertension. However, it is not clear whether this effect is sustained beyond the treatment period.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of metoprolol for the treatment of intermittent claudication.		
CD003427	Prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous sickle cell disease, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether prophylactic penicillin in children with sickle cell anemia reduces the incidence of pneumococcal septicemia.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the two included trials is insufficient to determine whether the use of pneumococcal vaccine in children with sickle cell disease prevents the development of serotype-specific IgG antibodies. The use of vaccine in this population is associated with a reduction in the risk of severe adverse events.		
CD001168	Although topical steroids are considered to be first line treatment, we identified no RCTs that compared steroids with placebo in patients with symptomatic OLP. From the trials in this review there is no evidence that one steroid is any more effective than another. There is weak evidence that aloe vera may reduce the pain of OLP and improve the clinical signs of disease compared to placebo. There is weak and unreliable evidence that cyclosporin may reduce pain and clinical signs of OLP. There is no evidence that other calcineurin inhibitors reduce pain compared to either steroids or placebo. From the 28 trials included in this systematic review, the wide range of interventions compared means there is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of any specific treatment as being superior.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of oral lichen planus.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence to support the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of OLP. There is a need for large well-designed RCTs to assess the long-term effects of topical and systemic steroids.		
CD000146	All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.	VNCH8M	NRT is an effective method of supporting smokers to quit. However, the evidence is limited by the number of studies and the heterogeneity of the interventions. There is a need for further research into the effectiveness of NRT in primary care settings.	SPNXTA	Tailoring the dose and duration of NRT is difficult, as is the method of delivering the drug. The short-term benefits of NNT are not clear. The long-term effects are not known.		
CD003654	Diuretics are preferred first-line over CCBs to optimize reduction of cardiovascular events. The review does not distinguish between CCBs, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, but does provide evidence supporting the use of CCBs over β-blockers. Many of the differences found in the current review are not robust and further trials might change the conclusions. More well-designed RCTs studying the mortality and morbidity of patients taking CCBs as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension, different ages, and with different co-morbidities such as diabetes.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of calcium channel blockers for the treatment of hypertension.	VNCH8M	ACE inhibitors are effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of ACE inhibitors over other first-line treatments for hypertension.		
CD007979	As only one study was identified for inclusion, the results are inadequate to inform clinical practice in regard to the use of email for clinical communication between healthcare professionals. Future research needs to use high-quality study designs that take advantage of the most recent developments in information technology, with consideration of the complexity of email as an intervention, and costs.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that electronic health promotion interventions may be effective in increasing the uptake of primary care services provided by primary health providers. However, the evidence is limited and the quality of the evidence was low. The evidence is weak and does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend the use of electronic health promotions as a standard part of primary health care services.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of interventions to prevent fractures in post-menopausal women. The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the effectiveness of interventions to prevent fractures in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis. The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the effectiveness of interventions to prevent fractures in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.		
CD005137	In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.	VNCH8M	Patching is effective in improving visual acuity in children aged 3 to 17 years. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend full-time patching for treating moderate to severe amblyopia.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of patching for amblyopia in children aged three to seven years.		
CD003051	Surgical sealants reduce postoperative air leaks and time to chest drain removal but this reduction is not always associated with a reduction in length of postoperative hospital stay. Therefore, systematic use of surgical sealants with the objective of reducing hospital stay cannot be recommended at the moment. More and larger randomized controlled clinical trials are needed.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of surgical sealants to reduce the risk of postoperative air leaks.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of fibrin glue for the prevention of air leaks after lung resections. The evidence is limited, however, and the evidence is not strong enough to support its routine use. The evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of fibrin glue for the prevention of air leaks after lung resections.		
CD004888	Peginterferon plus ribavirin may be considered a treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C and stable HIV who have not received treatment for hepatitis C as the intervention may clear the blood of HCV RNA. Supporting evidence comes mainly from the analysis of this non-validated surrogate outcome assessed in comparisons against other antiviral treatments. There is no evidence on treatment of patients who have relapsed or did not respond to previous therapy. Careful monitoring of adverse events is warranted.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that interferon-only regimens are more effective than interferons-only for HCV infection. Interferon is associated with a higher incidence of adverse events than interfon-alone regimens, but the safety profile of interferron-alone is not clear.	VNCH8M	Interferon-ribavirin is more effective than interferon-peg-INF in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients. However, the adverse events associated with interferon-ribavirin are higher and the duration of treatment longer.		
CD008870	Sulfasalazine has modest efficacy compared to placebo and is inferior to corticosteroids for the treatment of mild to moderately active Crohn's disease. Olsalazine and low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) are not superior to placebo. High dose mesalamine (3 to 4.5 g/day) is not more effective than placebo for inducing response or remission. High dose mesalamine was inferior to budesonide for inducing remission in a single trial. In conclusion, sulfasalazine shows modest efficacy for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. However, the existing data show little benefit for 5-aminosalicylates.	VNCH8M	5-ASA is effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Adverse events are common and not serious.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of 5-aminosalicylic acid in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. The evidence is based on small trials and is limited by the heterogeneity of the included trials. The results are limited by the small number of patients included in each trial and the heterogeneity of the included trials.

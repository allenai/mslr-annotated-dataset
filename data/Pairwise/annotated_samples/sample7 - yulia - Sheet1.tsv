CD007289	P-Chem may reduce the risk of progression to GTN in women with CMs who are at a high risk of malignant transformation; however, current evidence in favour of P-Chem is limited by the poor methodological quality and small size of the included studies. As P-Chem may increase drug resistance, delay treatment of GTN and expose women unnecessarily to toxic side effects, this practice cannot currently be recommended.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of prophylactic chemotherapy for patients with persistent trophoblastic disease. The results suggest that prophylactic chemotherapy may be beneficial in patients at high risk of developing secondary malignancy. The is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal prophylactic chemotherapy for patients with persistent trophoblastic disease.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chemotherapy for patients with complete hydatidiform mole.	A	
CD001036	Extended tip spatulas of various designs appear to be better for collecting endocervical cells than the commonly used Ayre spatula. The most effective combination appears to be the cytobrush with an extended tip spatula. The rate of detection of endocervical cells appears to be a valid and convenient surrogate for the ability to detect dyskaryosis and for adequate smear rates. The ability of the extended tip spatula with the cytobrush compared with the extended tip spatula alone to detect disease, needs to be evaluated in a trial.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any one method of cervical cytology for the screening of women. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of spatula and to support the use of spatula plus brush for the screening of women. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of spatula and to support the use of spatula plus brush for the screening of women.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular sampling technique for cervical screening. The results of this review suggest that there is a small but statistically significant difference between the methods used for cervical smear collection.	A	Both are incorrect, but B is incorrect AND contradictory
CD003782	There is limited evidence to support the use of pilocarpine hydrochloride in the treatment of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction. Currently, there is little evidence to support the use of other parasympathomimetic drugs in the treatment of this condition. Available studies suggest approximately half of patients will respond, but side effects to responders can be problematic. Adverse effects are dose dependant therefore it is important to keep dose to 5 mg tds.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pilocarpine for the symptomatic relief of post-radiation dry mouth.	PX7SGV	Thereral pilocarpine hydrochloride is an effective treatment for the treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence to support its use.	A	
CD000246	This review fails to demonstrate a clear overall benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment for preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. This treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. Further research may be justified (when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available) in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture, and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective. [Note: The 17 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antibiotics for women with intact membranes. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a benefit in terms of preterm birth, or whether there is a reduction in neonatal morbidity.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics in the management of preterm labour. Further research is required to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen.	A	
CD000123	Lipid-lowering therapy is effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in people with PAD. It may also improve local symptoms. Until further evidence on the relative effectiveness of different lipid-lowering agents is available, use of a statin in people with PAD and a blood cholesterol level ≥ 3.5 mmol/litre is most indicated.	AQ85CE	Atorvastatin appears to be effective in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with IC. The effect of atorvastonatin on walking performance is modest, but may be clinically important. The clinical significance of the observed effect is unclear.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of statins in the treatment of patients with peripheral arterial disease.	A	I tend to choose the extractive summaries which are only partially correct in terms of PICO than the more abstractive ones which can have a more general/correct PICO but incorrect relations
CD004128	Conventional cooling methods to induce mild therapeutic hypothermia seem to improve survival and neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. Our review supports the current best medical practice as recommended by the International Resuscitation Guidelines.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of hypothermia for the treatment of patients with acute cardiac arrest. The large, well-designed, multi-centre trial is needed to determine the optimal hypothermia dose and duration.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of hypothermia in patients with cardiac arrest. Further research is needed.	B	
CD008871	Low-dose rate brachytherapy did not reduce biochemical recurrence-free survival versus radical prostatectomy at 5 years. For short-term severe adverse events, low-dose rate brachytherapy was significantly more favorable for urinary incontinence, but radical prostatectomy was significantly more favorable for urinary irritation. Evidence is based on one RCT with high risk of bias.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of brastatic therapy for patients with prostate cancer. The is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to assess the effect of brastatic therapy on overall survival and on the quality of life of patients with prostate cancer.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of radical retropubic prostatectomy for the treatment of low-risk CaP.	B	A is more to the point but contains gibberish itervention (brastatic therapy)
CD007872	Tranexamic acid decreases postpartum blood loss after vaginal birth and after caesarean section based on two RCTs of unclear quality which reported on only a few outcomes. Further investigations are needed to confirm efficacy and safety of this regimen for preventing PPH. These results also provide a basis for the investigation of tranexamic acid for the treatment of PPH.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that tranexamic acid is effective in reducing blood loss in postpartum women. The results of the included studies are based on small numbers of women and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tranexamic acid to reduce postpartum blood loss after caesarian section.	A	B has a more narrow P
CD004317	Most studies to date have shown no benefit of strategies to improve adherence and continuation. These trials have important limitations, however. Three had small sample sizes, four had high losses to follow up, and the intervention and its intensity varied across the studies. High-quality research is a priority, since adherence and continuation are fundamentally important to the successful use of hormonal contraceptives.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of postpartum reminders for women with an unplanned pregnancy.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the included studies was limited. There is a need for more research to evaluate the effectiveness of peer support for contraceptive use by women aged 14 to 19 years.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	Both refer to very narrow Ps and Is
CD005237	We know very little of the effects of these drugs regarding service outcomes, general functioning and behaviours, engagement with services and treatment satisfaction from evaluative studies. There was generally a high rate of attrition in the trials and there appears to be little to differentiate between risperidone and olanzapine except on issues of adverse effects. Both drugs are associated with a reduction in psychotic symptoms but both commonly cause unpleasant adverse effects.	AQ85CE	Clozapine may be more effective than placebo in the treatment of schizophrenia, but its adverse effects are similar to those of other atypical drugs. Its adverse effects profile is similar to that of typical antipsychotics, with its tendency to induce weight gain and sedation.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia.	A	
CD001055	Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy reduce the proportion of women who continue to smoke in late pregnancy, and reduce low birthweight and preterm birth. Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy need to be implemented in all maternity care settings. Given the difficulty many pregnant women addicted to tobacco have quitting during pregnancy, population-based measures to reduce smoking and social inequalities should be supported.	VNCH8M	Motivational interviewing may be effective in helping pregnant women to quit smoking. However, the evidence is limited. There is a need for further research.	SPNXTA	Psychosocial and psychological interventions that help pregnant smokers to quit during pregnancy and postpartum are effective. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effect of these interventions on perinatal outcomes. There is a need for further research.	B	
CD009379	Conclusive evidence supporting the treatment of acute ocular surface burns with AMT is lacking. Heterogeneity of disease presentation, variations in treatment, undefined criteria for treatment success and failure, and non-uniform outcome measures are some of the factors complicating the search for clear evidence regarding this treatment.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of amniotic membrane transplantation in the treatment of acute ocular burns. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether amnio membrane transplant therapy is beneficial in the management of acute OA.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of amniotic membrane transplantation as an adjunct to medical therapy in patients with acute ocular burns.	A	
CD003421	These results suggest that calcium channel blockers given in the peri-operative period may reduce the incidence of ATN post-transplantation. The result should be treated with caution due to the heterogeneity of the trials which made comparison of studies and pooling of data difficult.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium channel blockers in the management of acute tubular necrosis following renal transplantation. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium channel blockers in the management of acute tubular necrosis following renal transplantation.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that immunosuppression may improve the outcome of kidney transplantation recipients. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support or refute the use of immunossuppression in this setting. Calcium channel blockers and verapamil may have a beneficial effect on renal function but the evidence for their beneficial effects is inconclusive. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of calcium channel blocker administration and to compare these with other immunocompressive agents, including calcium channel blockers.	B	
CD003264	One year of 28 IU/m²/wk rhGH in children with CKD resulted in a 3.88 cm increase in height velocity above that of untreated patients. Studies were too short to determine if continuing treatment resulted in an increase in final adult height.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of growth hormone therapy in children with chronic renal failure and persistent growth retardation.	VNCH8M	Recombinant human growth hormone is effective in improving height in children with chronic renal failure. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend its use for children with severe growth retardation.	B	
CD002964	Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence to suggest that culturally sensitive videotape may be beneficial for improving parent-infant interaction. However, the evidence is too limited to draw any conclusions. Further research is needed to assess the effects of culturally insensitive videotape on infant and social functioning.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of a short-term intervention for mothers to improve their infant's social development. The evidence is limited, however, and the results of this review suggest that short-term interventions may be effective in improving infant's social development.	B	
CD000143	Implications for practice: nasal CPAP is effective in preventing failure of extubation in preterm infants following a period of endotracheal intubation and IPPV. Implication for research: further definition of the gestational age and weight groups in whom these results apply is warranted. Optimal levels of NCPAP as well as methods of administration remain to be determined.	SPNXTA	The use of NCPAP in preterm infants reduces the risk of reintubation and oxygen dependency, but not the requirement for additional support. There is no evidence of a difference in respiratory failure between the two methods of extubation.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of NCPAP to prevent the need for re-intubation of preterm infants who are extubated from mechanical ventilation.	A	
CD004888	Peginterferon plus ribavirin may be considered a treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C and stable HIV who have not received treatment for hepatitis C as the intervention may clear the blood of HCV RNA. Supporting evidence comes mainly from the analysis of this non-validated surrogate outcome assessed in comparisons against other antiviral treatments. There is no evidence on treatment of patients who have relapsed or did not respond to previous therapy. Careful monitoring of adverse events is warranted.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of interferon plus ribavirin for HCV treatment in HIV-infected patients.	VNCH8M	Interferon-ribavirin is more effective than interferon-peg-INF in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients. However, the adverse events associated with interferon-ribavirin are higher and the duration of treatment longer.	B	
CD000123	Lipid-lowering therapy is effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in people with PAD. It may also improve local symptoms. Until further evidence on the relative effectiveness of different lipid-lowering agents is available, use of a statin in people with PAD and a blood cholesterol level ≥ 3.5 mmol/litre is most indicated.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs for the treatment of intermittent claudication.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of statins in the treatment of patients with peripheral arterial disease.	B	
CD007771	The evidence base for the use of vitamin D for chronic pain in adults is poor at present. This is due to low quality and insufficient randomised controlled trials in this area of research.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of alpha-OH-D3 in the treatment of RA.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin D for the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.	A	
CD005959	The available evidence shows that intramedullary nailing is associated with an increased risk of shoulder impingement, with a related increase in restriction of shoulder movement and need for removal of metalwork. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there were any other important differences, including in functional outcome, between dynamic compression plating and locked intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fractures.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intramedullary nails for humerus fractures. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal technique for intramedullary nail fixation.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the surgical techniques used in the treatment of humerus fractures. Further research is needed.	A	
CD002855	Safe and effective medical abortion methods are available. Combined regimens are more effective than single agents. In the combined regimen, the dose of mifepristone can be lowered to 200 mg without significantly decreasing the method effectiveness. Vaginal misoprostol is more effective than oral administration, and has less side effects than sublingual or buccal. Some results are limited by the small numbers of participants on which they are based. Almost all trials were conducted in settings with good access to emergency services, which may limit the generalizability of these results.	AQ85CE	The use of mifepristone in combination with gemeprost is effective in inducing immediate and selective abortion. Gemeprost may be less effective than mifenecristone.	SPNXTA	Vaginal misoprostol is an effective method of medical abortion in early pregnancy. It is less effective than mifepristone or mifecristone, or at the same dose, and is associated with higher rates of incomplete abortion. [Note: The six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the analysis once assessed.]	B	
CD003231	The data from the present meta-analysis indicate that tumour recurrence was significantly reduced with intravesical BCG compared to MMC only in the subgroup of patients at high risk of tumour recurrence. However, there was no difference in terms of disease progression or survival, and the decision to use either agent might be based on adverse events and cost.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of immunomodulators in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether immunotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether immunotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer.	A	
CD008871	Low-dose rate brachytherapy did not reduce biochemical recurrence-free survival versus radical prostatectomy at 5 years. For short-term severe adverse events, low-dose rate brachytherapy was significantly more favorable for urinary incontinence, but radical prostatectomy was significantly more favorable for urinary irritation. Evidence is based on one RCT with high risk of bias.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of brastatic therapy for patients with prostate cancer. The is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to assess the effect of brastatic therapy on overall survival and on the quality of life of patients with prostate cancer.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether radical retropubic prostatectomy is superior to brachytherapy for the treatment of low-risk CaP.	B

The is insufficient evidence to support the use of spatula and to support the use of spatula plus brush for the screening of women. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of spatula and to support the use of spatula plus brush for the screening of women.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any one sampling technique for the detection of persistent cervical cancer. The choice of which sampling technique to use should depend on the type of smear and the characteristics of the smear sample.	B	
CD007166	Compared to placebo, adjuvant therapy reduces off-time, levodopa dose, and improves UPDRS scores in PD patients who develop motor complications on levodopa therapy. However, this is at the expense of increased dyskinesia and numerous other side-effects. Indirect comparisons suggest that dopamine agonist therapy may be more effective than COMTI and MAOBI therapy, which have comparable efficacy. However, as indirect comparisons should be interpreted with caution, direct head-to-head randomised trials assessing the impact of these different drug classes on overall patient-rated quality of life are needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the drugs included in this review for the treatment of PD.	VNCH8M	Entacapone, tolcapone, and entacapone reduce levodopa dose in patients with Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations. Pramipexole and pramipexole may reduce levodopa dose in patients with Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations. Pramipexole may reduce levodopa dose in patients with Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations.	B	
CD004277	There is limited evidence that cyclosporine is more effective than standard treatment alone for severe ulcerative colitis. The relatively quick response makes the short-term use of cyclosporine potentially attractive, but the long-term benefit is unclear, when adverse events such as cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity may become more obvious. There is a need for additional research on quality of life, costs and long-term results from cyclosporine therapy in severe ulcerative colitis.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cyclosporine as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with severe ulcerative colitis.	PX7SGV	Thereclosporine appears to be an effective treatment for patients with severe UC. However, there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an alternative to glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of acute UC.	A	
CD008361	We could not find convincing evidence that NBI is significantly better than high definition WLC for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas. We found evidence that NBI might be better than standard definition WLC and equal to high definition WLC for detection the patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of narrow-band imaging over white light for colonoscopy.	SPNXTA	The use of NBI compared with white light did not significantly improve the neoplasm detection rate. However, NBI was associated with an increased risk of non-polypoid adenoma, which may have an important role in the screening of colorectal neoplasias.	B	At least B tried to capture multiple aspects
CD007872	Tranexamic acid decreases postpartum blood loss after vaginal birth and after caesarean section based on two RCTs of unclear quality which reported on only a few outcomes. Further investigations are needed to confirm efficacy and safety of this regimen for preventing PPH. These results also provide a basis for the investigation of tranexamic acid for the treatment of PPH.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that tranexamic acid is effective in reducing blood loss in postpartum women. The results of the included studies are based on small numbers of women and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution.	AQ85CE	Treatment with tranexamic acid immediately before caesarean section reduces the risk of postpartum haemorrhage and the need for transfusion.	B	B has a narrower P but correct direction
CD005508	There is currently no evidence that beta blockers adversely affect walking distance in people with intermittent claudication. However, due to the lack of large published trials beta blockers should be used with caution if clinically indicated.	AQ85CE	There is no evidence to support the use of beta-blockers in patients with IC.	SPNXTA	There is currently insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of beta-adrenergic blockers in patients with chronic intermittent claudication.	A	Both are incorrect but B is worse because of "chronic"
CD006069	In two trials of protein containing synthetic surfactants compared to animal derived surfactant extract, no statistically different clinical differences in death and chronic lung disease were noted. In general, clinical outcomes between the two groups were similar. Further well designed studies of adequate size and power will help confirm and refine these findings.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the use of surfactants in the treatment of preterm infants reduces the risk of death or the incidence of neonatal complications. The evidence is insufficient to determine whether the use of surfactants in preterm infants reduces the risk of death or the incidence of neonatal complications.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of lucinactant for the prevention of RDS.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	Both answer irrelevant clinical questions rather than the one posed in target and both lack a comparatpr
CD003032	Although ethosuximide, lamotrigine and valproate are commonly used to treat people with absence seizures we have insufficient evidence to inform clinical practice, and the few trials included in this review were of poor methodological quality and did not have sufficient number of participants. More trials of better quality are needed.	AQ85CE	The results of this review suggest that melatonin may be beneficial in the treatment of children and young people with epilepsy and intellectual disability. However, the quality of the evidence is low. The results are based on a small number of small studies with a high risk of bias. The quality of evidence for other interventions is low and the quality is poor. There is a need for further well-designed, adequately powered, high quality randomised controlled trials to determine the efficacy and safety of melatonin.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of melatonin for the treatment of absence seizures in children and adolescents.	B	
CD002265	This systematic review found one randomised controlled trial with a small number of patients in the different clinical subgroups of neurological manifestation. There is very low-quality evidence that cyclophosphamide is more effective in reducing symptoms of neuropsychiatric involvement in SLE compared with methylprednisolone. However, properly designed randomised controlled trials that involve large numbers of individuals, with explicit clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria, sufficient duration of follow-up and description of all relevant outcome measures, are necessary to guide practice. As we did not find any new trials to include in this review at update, the conclusions of the review did not change.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to determine which drug is the most effective in the treatment of NPSLE. There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of different drugs in the management of NPP. Such trials should be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org/).	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether cyclophosphamide is more effective than methylprednisolone in the treatment of severe neurological complications in NPSLE.	B	
CD007566	This systematic review indicates that exercise may have beneficial effects on HRQoL and certain HRQoL domains including cancer-specific concerns (e.g. breast cancer), body image/self-esteem, emotional well-being, sexuality, sleep disturbance, social functioning, anxiety, fatigue, and pain at varying follow-up periods. The positive results must be interpreted cautiously due to the heterogeneity of exercise programs tested and measures used to assess HRQoL and HRQoL domains, and the risk of bias in many trials. Further research is required to investigate how to sustain positive effects of exercise over time and to determine essential attributes of exercise (mode, intensity, frequency, duration, timing) by cancer type and cancer treatment for optimal effects on HRQoL and its domains.	VNCH8M	Physical activity may have a positive effect on fatigue and physical activity in cancer patients. However, the evidence is limited and the results should be interpreted with caution.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of exercise as a treatment for fatigue in cancer patients.	A	
CD009274	Topical steroid is a beneficial treatment for CRS without polyps and the adverse effects are minor. It may be included in a comprehensive treatment of CRS without polyps. Direct delivery of steroid to the sinuses may bring more beneficial effect. Further studies comparing different topical drug delivery methods to the sinuses, with appropriate treatment duration (longer than 12 weeks), are required.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.	AQ85CE	BDP is effective in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. The short-term efficacy of BDP is not clear. Long-term safety and tolerability of BPD is not known.	A	B is contradictory and I is more narrow
CD006432	There is insufficient good quality evidence to make recommendations about the relative effect of simultaneous bilateral training compared to placebo, no intervention or usual care. We identified evidence that suggests that bilateral training may be no more (or less) effective than usual care or other upper limb interventions for performance in ADL, functional movement of the upper limb or motor impairment outcomes.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of unilateral or bilateral arm training in the rehabilitation of people with chronic stroke.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of bilateral arm training for stroke survivors. Further research is required.	B	
CD001331	We found evidence favouring the corticosteroid MP for acute exacerbation in MS patients. Data are insufficient to reliably estimate effect of corticosteroids on prevention of new exacerbations and reduction of long-term disability.Studies assessing long term risk/benefit and adverse effects of corticosteroids in MS patients are urgently needed.	SPNXTA	High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone has a beneficial effect on the progression of relapse and disability in patients with MS. The adverse effects are mild and transient, but the long-term effects are likely to be clinically important.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of methylprednisolone for the treatment of MS.	B	B is also wrong because it denies any positive effect, but A claims beneficial effects which are denied in target
CD008112	High quality evidence suggests that there is no clinically relevant difference between SMT and other interventions for reducing pain and improving function in patients with chronic low-back pain. Determining cost-effectiveness of care has high priority. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect in relation to inert interventions and sham SMT, and data related to recovery.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the interventions included in this review. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the interventions included in this review.

AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of back school as a treatment for subacute LBP.	A	
CD003893	Methyldopa lowers blood pressure to varying degrees compared to placebo for patients with primary hypertension. Its effect on clinical outcomes, however, remains uncertain.	SPNXTA	Methyldopa is effective in reducing blood pressure in moderate to high hypertensive patients with moderate to severe hypertension. However, it is not clear whether this effect is sustained beyond the treatment period.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of metoprolol for the treatment of intermittent claudication.	A	B seems to be incorrectly copied here
CD000246	This review fails to demonstrate a clear overall benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment for preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. This treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. Further research may be justified (when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available) in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture, and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective. [Note: The 17 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	SPNXTA	Antibiotic treatment is associated with a reduction in the rate of preterm birth, a reduction of suspected sepsis, and an increased rate of NICU admission. However, there is no evidence of a benefit on other important maternal and neonatal outcomes. Further research is required to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen for women with threatened idiopathic preterm labour.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antibiotics for women with intact membranes. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a benefit in terms of preterm birth, or whether there is a reduction in neonatal morbidity.	B	
CD000432	The results of this review do not support the use of prophylactic caffeine for preterm infants at risk of apnoea. Any future studies need to examine the effects of prophylactic methylxanthines in preterm infants at higher risk of apnoea. This should include examination of important clinical outcomes such as need for IPPV, neonatal morbidity, length of hospital stay and long term development.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of caffeine for the treatment of preterm infants with apnoea.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of caffeine to treat apnea in preterm infants.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	Both are about treatment rather than risk prevention

CD001055	Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy reduce the proportion of women who continue to smoke in late pregnancy, and reduce low birthweight and preterm birth. Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy need to be implemented in all maternity care settings. Given the difficulty many pregnant women addicted to tobacco have quitting during pregnancy, population-based measures to reduce smoking and social inequalities should be supported.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that there is no evidence to support the use of antenatal smoking cessation interventions to improve smoking cessation rates among pregnant women.

CD009154	This review showed a significant effect in favour of progesterone for luteal phase support, favouring synthetic progesterone over micronized progesterone. Overall, the addition of other substances such as estrogen or hCG did not seem to improve outcomes. We also found no evidence favouring a specific route or duration of administration of progesterone. We found that hCG, or hCG plus progesterone, was associated with a higher risk of OHSS. The use of hCG should therefore be avoided. There were significant results showing a benefit from addition of GnRH agonist to progesterone for the outcomes of live birth, clinical pregnancy and ongoing pregnancy. For now, progesterone seems to be the best option as luteal phase support, with better pregnancy results when synthetic progesterone is used.	VNCH8M	GnRH agonists and progesterone are effective in increasing the live birth rate in women undergoing ART cycles. However, the effect on live birth rate is not clear.

CD000246	This review fails to demonstrate a clear overall benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment for preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. This treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. Further research may be justified (when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available) in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture, and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective. [Note: The 17 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	SPNXTA	Antibiotic treatment is associated with a reduction in the rate of preterm birth, a reduction of suspected sepsis, and an increased rate of NICU admission.

CD002869	The effects of general antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood, or both, remain largely unknown. Individualized prenatal education directed toward avoidance of a repeat caesarean birth does not increase the rate of vaginal birth after caesarean section. [Note: the 58 citations in the awaiting classification section may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that antenatal education and support programs are beneficial for the mother and baby during pregnancy and postpartum. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the introduction of such programs to all women. Further research is needed to assess the effects of antenatal training on maternal attachment and maternal well-being.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antenatal education to promote vaginal birth after cesarean section.	B	
CD004950	If available, breastfeeding or breast milk should be used to alleviate procedural pain in neonates undergoing a single painful procedure rather than placebo, positioning or no intervention. Administration of glucose/sucrose had similar effectiveness as breastfeeding for reducing pain. The effectiveness of breast milk for painful procedure should be studied in the preterm population, as there are currently a limited number of studies in the literature that have assessed it's effectiveness in this population.

CD006616	Overall, this meta-analysis puts doubt on the safety and utility of intravenous N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy in SIRS and sepsis. At best, N-acetylcysteine is ineffective in reducing mortality and complications in this patient population. At worst, it can be harmful, especially when administered later than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, by causing cardiovascular depression. Unless future RCTs provide evidence of treatment effect, clinicians should not routinely use intravenous N-acetylcysteine in SIRS or sepsis and academics should not promote its use.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics in patients with severe sepsis.

CD006728	The current evidence base is too heterogeneous and sparse to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of family therapy in the treatment of depression. At this point, use of psychological interventions for the treatment of depression for which there is already an evidence-base would seem to be preferable to family therapy.

CD005646	In the small trials included in this review, when compared to cotrimoxazole rechallenge for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, cotrimoxazole desensitization resulted in fewer treatment discontinuations and overall adverse reactions in HIV-infected patients with a previous history of mild or moderate hypersensitivity to cotrimoxazole. Paediatric data and trials in resource-poor settings are urgently required. Further randomised controlled trials are also needed for the treatment of opportunistic infections, treating-through, adjunctive medications, and different desensitization-dosing schedules.

CD005523	Aquatic exercise appears to have some beneficial short-term effects for patients with hip and/or knee OA while no long-term effects have been documented. Based on this, one may consider using aquatic exercise as the first part of a longer exercise programme for osteoarthritis patients. The controlled and randomised studies in this area are still too few to give further recommendations on how to apply the therapy, and studies of clearly defined patient groups with long-term outcomes are needed to decide on the further use of this therapy in the treatment of osteoarthritis.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific exercise programme for the treatment of hip osteoarthritis.

CD006355	There is some evidence from one study at high risk of bias that topical glyceryl trinitrate is more effective than placebo for rotator cuff disease among patients with acute symptoms (< seven-days duration), but there is insufficient evidence to be certain about their longer-term effects. Headache was a common side effect in one trial and any benefits of treatment need to be balanced against the risk of headache.

CD006251	The vast majority of technical, human and organisational interventions that are recommended by standard texts of safety, consultants and safety courses have not been adequately evaluated. There is no evidence that introducing regulations for reducing fatal and non-fatal injuries are effective as such. There is neither evidence that regionally oriented safety campaigns, training, inspections nor the introduction of occupational health services are effective at reducing non-fatal injuries in construction companies. There is low-quality evidence that company-oriented safety interventions such as a multifaceted safety campaign and a multifaceted drug workplace programme can reduce non-fatal injuries among construction workers. Additional strategies are needed to increase the compliance of employers and workers to the safety measures that are prescribed by regulation. Continuing company-oriented interventions among management and construction workers, such as a targeted safety campaign or a drug-free workplace programme, seem to have an effect in reducing injuries in the longer term.

CD008012	Psychological interventions and pharmacological interventions with SSRIs may have a small yet clinically meaningful effect on depression outcomes in CAD patients. No beneficial effects on the reduction of mortality rates and cardiac events were found.

CD007166	Compared to placebo, adjuvant therapy reduces off-time, levodopa dose, and improves UPDRS scores in PD patients who develop motor complications on levodopa therapy. However, this is at the expense of increased dyskinesia and numerous other side-effects. Indirect comparisons suggest that dopamine agonist therapy may be more effective than COMTI and MAOBI therapy, which have comparable efficacy. However, as indirect comparisons should be interpreted with caution, direct head-to-head randomised trials assessing the impact of these different drug classes on overall patient-rated quality of life are needed.	PX7SGV	Thereramipexole is an effective adjunct to levodopa therapy in the treatment of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. However, there is insufficient evidence to support its use.

CD009275	Data for most comparisons were only available from single studies and they are too small for reliable conclusions about which types of dietary advice are the most suitable for women with GDM. Based on the current available evidence, we did not find any significant benefits of the diets investigated. Further larger trials with sufficient power to assess the effects of different diets for women with GDM on maternal and infant health outcomes are needed. Outcomes such as longer-term health outcomes for women and their babies, women's quality of life and health service cost should be included.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary interventions to improve glucose control in women with gestational diabetes.

CD004207	Treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with metalloporphyrins may reduce neonatal bilirubin levels and decrease the need for phototherapy and hospitalization. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that treatment with a metalloporphyrin decreases the risk of neonatal kernicterus or of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment due to bilirubin encephalopathy. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that cutaneous photosensitivity is increased with metalloporphyrin treatment. Routine treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a metalloporphyrin cannot be recommended at present.

CD002200	The results of our review suggest that there is an overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Because of the wide variation in the follow-up programmes used in the included studies it is not possible to infer from the data the best combination and frequency of clinic (or family practice) visits, blood tests, endoscopic procedures and radiological investigations to maximise the outcomes for these patients. Nor is it possible to estimate the potential harms or costs of intensifying follow up for these patients in order to adopt a cost-effective approach in this clinical area. Large clinical trials underway or about to commence are likely to contribute valuable further information to clarify these areas of clinical uncertainty.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that surveillance of patients with colorectal cancer improves overall survival or recurrence rates. The is some evidence that surveillance improves survival in patients with rectal cancer. The is no evidence that surveillance improves survival in patients with colon cancer.

CD005083	Honey dressings do not increase rates of healing significantly in venous leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression. Honey may delay healing in partial- and full-thickness burns in comparison to early excision and grafting, and in cutaneous Leishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. Honey might be superior to some conventional dressing materials, but there is considerable uncertainty about the replicability and applicability of this evidence. There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other types of wounds, and health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressings until sufficient evidence of effect is available.

AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of honey for the treatment of acute postoperative wound infections. Further research is needed.	A	
CD002855	Safe and effective medical abortion methods are available. Combined regimens are more effective than single agents. In the combined regimen, the dose of mifepristone can be lowered to 200 mg without significantly decreasing the method effectiveness. Vaginal misoprostol is more effective than oral administration, and has less side effects than sublingual or buccal. Some results are limited by the small numbers of participants on which they are based. Almost all trials were conducted in settings with good access to emergency services, which may limit the generalizability of these results.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral mifepristone as a first line agent for medical abortion.	SPNXTA	Vaginal misoprostol is an effective method of medical abortion in early pregnancy. It is less effective than mifepristone or mifecristone, or at the same dose, and is associated with higher rates of incomplete abortion.

CD006866	Oral acyclovir did not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether other antiviral treatments prevent PHN. Additional well-designed, randomised controlled trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents, with a greater number of participants are needed. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.

CD002992	Cardioselective beta-blockers given in mild to moderate reversible airway disease or COPD do not produce adverse respiratory effects. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, these agents should not be withheld from such patients. Long-term safety still needs to be established.	AQ85CE	Atenolol is effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations and mortality in patients with chronic asthma. The clinical significance of this finding is limited by the small number of patients studied and the small sample size of the included studies. Atenolols may be more effective than inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of acute exacerbations, but the evidence is weak and inconclusive.	VNCH8M	Atenolol is a beta-blocker with a clinically important effect on heart rate and blood pressure. The cardioselectivity of atenolol is low and is probably due to the fact that it is a beta-blocker.	A	B does not mention P
CD001055	Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy reduce the proportion of women who continue to smoke in late pregnancy, and reduce low birthweight and preterm birth. Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy need to be implemented in all maternity care settings.

CD003421	These results suggest that calcium channel blockers given in the peri-operative period may reduce the incidence of ATN post-transplantation. The result should be treated with caution due to the heterogeneity of the trials which made comparison of studies and pooling of data difficult.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that immunosuppression may improve the outcome of kidney transplantation recipients. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support or refute the use of immunossuppression in this setting. Calcium channel blockers and verapamil may have a beneficial effect on renal function but the evidence for their beneficial effects is inconclusive.

CD007394	At a cut-off value 0.5 ODI in a population of 100 patients with a disease prevalence of 8% (overall median prevalence), 2 patients who have IA, will be missed (sensitivity 78%, 22% false negatives), and 17 patients will be treated or further referred unnecessarily (specificity of 81%, 19% false negatives). If we use the test at cut-off value 1.5 in the same population, that will mean that 3 IA patients will be missed (sensitivity 64%, 36% false negatives) and 5 patients will be treated or referred unnecessarily (specificity of 95%, 5% false negatives).

CD001367	In conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that treatment with vitamin K antagonists reduces the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism for as long as it is used. However, the absolute risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism declines over time, while the risk for major bleeding remains. Thus, the efficacy of vitamin K antagonist administration decreases over time since the index event.

CD002271	In preterm infants with respiratory distress the application of CDP either as CPAP or CNP is associated with reduced respiratory failure and reduced mortality. CDP is associated with an increased rate of pneumothorax. Four out of six of these trials were done in the 1970's. Therefore, the applicability of these results to current practice is difficult to assess. Where resources are limited, such as in developing countries, CPAP for RDS may have a clinical role. Further research is required to determine the best mode of administration and the role of CDP in modern intensive care settings	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the routine use of CPAP in the treatment of neonates with HMD.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CIPP in the treatment of infants with hyaline membrane disease. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the role of CIPP in the management of this condition.	A	
CD004950	If available, breastfeeding or breast milk should be used to alleviate procedural pain in neonates undergoing a single painful procedure rather than placebo, positioning or no intervention. Administration of glucose/sucrose had similar effectiveness as breastfeeding for reducing pain. The effectiveness of breast milk for painful procedure should be studied in the preterm population, as there are currently a limited number of studies in the literature that have assessed it's effectiveness in this population.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of sucrose for the prevention of pain during blood sampling. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of sucrose for the prevention of pain during breastfeeding.

CD005208	There is currently not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the efficacy or safety of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors therapy in acute ischaemic stroke. Results from ongoing trials will help to understand the risk to benefit ratio of these agents.	PX7SGV	Thereciximab appears to be effective in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. However, there is a need for further well-designed randomised controlled trials in this area.	VNCH8M	There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of abciximab for acute ischemic stroke.	B	
CD002992	Cardioselective beta-blockers given in mild to moderate reversible airway disease or COPD do not produce adverse respiratory effects. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, these agents should not be withheld from such patients. Long-term safety still needs to be established.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of beta-1-agonists in the treatment of asthma. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of beta-1-agonists in the treatment of asthma.	VNCH8M	Atenolol is a beta-blocker with a clinically important effect on heart rate and blood pressure. The cardioselectivity of atenolol is low and is probably due to the fact that it is a beta-blocker.	B	Correct direction (unlike A) though Population is underspecified
CD001984	We conclude that there appears to be little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for these musculoskeletal disorders. However, multidisciplinary rehabilitation is a commonly used intervention for chronic musculoskeletal disorders, which cause much personal suffering and substantial economic loss to the society. There is a need for high quality trials in this field.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cognitive behavioural therapy for fibromyalgia. Further research is required to determine the optimal type of cognitive behavioural therapy for fibromyalgia.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for people with fibromyalgia.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	Equivalent, though both have an incorrect I (too narrow)
CD006133	Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods. We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by body mass index (obese versus normal).	VNCH8M	Lactation may be reduced by reducing the dose of progestogens in the combined oral contraceptive. However, the effect on lipid metabolism is not clear. The effect on blood pressure is not clear. There is no evidence of a difference in lipid metabolism between LNG and DS G. There is no evidence of a difference in blood pressure between LNG and DS G.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine the effects of oral contraceptives on glycosylated hemoglobin A1C and triglyceride levels.	B	
CD002964	Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence to suggest that culturally sensitive videotape may be beneficial for improving parent-infant interaction. However, the evidence is too limited to draw any conclusions. Further research is needed to assess the effects of culturally insensitive videotape on infant and social functioning.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of videotape as a means of improving parenting skills among young people.	B	
CD000220	Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes. The cure rate could probably be higher if more partners used the treatment.	AQ85CE	Antibiotic treatment with metronidazole is effective in reducing the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth among women infected with trichomoniasis. The risk of neonatal death is higher with metonidazol. The optimal dose and duration of treatment remains unclear.	SPNXTA	Treatment of asymptomatic trichomoniasis with metronidazole 48 hours or 48 hours apart does not prevent preterm birth in women with trichomiasis. However, it does reduce the risk of caesarean section and the time of birth. [Note: The four citations in the awaiting classification section may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	A	A is also wrong but B is gibberish
CD001112	Caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly, for up to four hours, in people with asthma. People may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing, as caffeine ingestion could cause misinterpretation of the results. Drinking caffeinated coffee before taking exhaled nitric oxide measurements does not appear to affect the results of the test, but more studies are needed to confirm this.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of caffeine for the treatment of asthma.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether caffeine is beneficial for asthma.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	Equally wrong
CD004878	Current evidence does not support a clinically relevant effect of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids on admissions or length of hospitalisation. Combined dexamethasone and epinephrine may reduce outpatient admissions, but results are exploratory and safety data limited. Future research should further assess the efficacy, harms and applicability of combined therapy.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of corticosteroids in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of children with bronchiolitis. The use of corticosteroids in children with bronchiolitis is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission. The use of corticosteroids in children with bronchiolitis is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission.	B	"higher risk of hospital admission" is incorrect but at least that aspect is mentioned (and the population is specified)
CD002265	This systematic review found one randomised controlled trial with a small number of patients in the different clinical subgroups of neurological manifestation. There is very low-quality evidence that cyclophosphamide is more effective in reducing symptoms of neuropsychiatric involvement in SLE compared with methylprednisolone. However, properly designed randomised controlled trials that involve large numbers of individuals, with explicit clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria, sufficient duration of follow-up and description of all relevant outcome measures, are necessary to guide practice. As we did not find any new trials to include in this review at update, the conclusions of the review did not change.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of SLE. The available evidence suggests that corticolic steroids may be effective in reducing the number of seizures and improving muscle strength and disability in patients with SLE, but the quality of the evidence is poor. There is a need for further well-designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal dose and duration of cortical steroids in the management of Sle.	JB6Z8F	Cyclophosphamide is more effective than MP in the treatment of acute, severe NPSLE.	A	
CD004888	Peginterferon plus ribavirin may be considered a treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C and stable HIV who have not received treatment for hepatitis C as the intervention may clear the blood of HCV RNA. Supporting evidence comes mainly from the analysis of this non-validated surrogate outcome assessed in comparisons against other antiviral treatments. There is no evidence on treatment of patients who have relapsed or did not respond to previous therapy. Careful monitoring of adverse events is warranted.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that interferon-only regimens are more effective than interferons-only for HCV infection. Interferon is associated with a higher incidence of adverse events than interfon-alone regimens, but the safety profile of interferron-alone is not clear.	VNCH8M	Interferon-ribavirin is more effective than interferon-peg-INF in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients. However, the adverse events associated with interferon-ribavirin are higher and the duration of treatment longer.	B	
CD003231	The data from the present meta-analysis indicate that tumour recurrence was significantly reduced with intravesical BCG compared to MMC only in the subgroup of patients at high risk of tumour recurrence. However, there was no difference in terms of disease progression or survival, and the decision to use either agent might be based on adverse events and cost.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of immunomodulators in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer.	AQ85CE	The use of BCG in patients with superficial bladder cancer reduces the risk of recurrence and progression, but the benefit is small. The optimal BCG regimen remains unclear.	B	
CD004219	Data from one small study suggest that using a percutaneous central venous catheter to deliver parenteral nutrition improves nutrient input. The significance of this in relation to long-term growth and developmental outcomes is unclear. Three studies suggested that the use of a percutaneous central venous catheter decreases the number of catheters/cannulae needed to deliver the nutrition. No evidence was found to suggest that percutaneous central venous catheter use increased the risk of adverse events, particularly systemic infection.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of peripheral catheters in neonates.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of peripherally inserted catheters for neonatal intensive care. The research is needed to determine whether the use of peripherally inserted catheters is associated with a reduction in the number of infants requiring intravenous therapy.	B	
CD001943	Loxapine is an antipsychotic which is not clearly distinct from typical or atypical drugs in terms of its effects on global or mental state. Loxapines profile of adverse effects is similar to that of the older generation of antipsychotic drugs.	SPNXTA	Loxapine appears to be an effective treatment for those with schizophrenia. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that it is superior to other commonly used antipsychotic drugs.

CD004873	Since the last publication of this review new good-quality evidence has appeared, strengthening the conclusions of the review. Chest physiotherapy does not improve the severity of the disease, respiratory parameters, or reduce length of hospital stay or oxygen requirements in hospitalised infants with acute bronchiolitis not on mechanical ventilation. Chest physiotherapy modalities (vibration and percussion or passive expiratory techniques) have shown equally negative results.

CD003051	Surgical sealants reduce postoperative air leaks and time to chest drain removal but this reduction is not always associated with a reduction in length of postoperative hospital stay. Therefore, systematic use of surgical sealants with the objective of reducing hospital stay cannot be recommended at the moment. More and larger randomized controlled clinical trials are needed.

CD003700	The evidence does not suggest a significant reduction in mortality, measures of morbidity, nor an effect on the clinical course of pneumonia with vitamin A adjunctive treatment in children with non-measles pneumonia. However, not all studies measured all outcomes, which limited the number of studies that could be incorporated into the meta-analyses, so that there may have been a lack of statistical power to detect statistically significant differences.

CD006728	The current evidence base is too heterogeneous and sparse to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of family therapy in the treatment of depression. At this point, use of psychological interventions for the treatment of depression for which there is already an evidence-base would seem to be preferable to family therapy. Further high quality trials examining the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of explicitly defined forms of family therapy are required.

CD004181	Immunoglobulins seem to be effective for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A. However, caution is warranted for the positive findings due to the limited number of trials, year of conductance, and risk of bias. Conductance of rigorous trials will be justifiable.	SPNXTA	This systematic review suggests that the administration of immunoglobulin prophylaxis to hepatitis A recruits following vaccination with HAV is effective for 4-6 months, but the effect may not be maintained.

CD003412	Overall there has been very little good quality research on treatments for BCC. Most trials have only evaluated BCCs in low risk locations. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments with surgery showing the lowest failure rates. Although cosmetic outcomes appear good with PDT, long-term follow-up data are needed. Other treatments might have some use but few have been compared to surgery. An ongoing study comparing imiquimod to surgery should clarify whether imiquimod is a useful option.

CD006097	Pooled data suggest that natalizumab is effective for induction of clinical response and remission in some patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. The clinical benefit of induction therapy with natalizumab in Crohn's disease should be weighed against the potential risk of serious adverse events. Preliminary data from the retrospective investigation of adverse events associated with natalizumab suggest that it may be possible to identify patients at risk for PML by testing for the appearance of JC virus in plasma.

CD007033	Placebo-controlled trials have established the benefits of both long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy for COPD patients as individual therapies. This review, which included trials allowing comparisons between LABA and ICS, has shown that the two therapies confer similar benefits across the majority of outcomes, including the frequency of exacerbations and mortality. Use of long-acting beta-agonists appears to confer a small additional benefit in terms of improvements in lung function compared to inhaled corticosteroids. On the other hand, inhaled corticosteroid therapy shows a small advantage over long-acting beta-agonist therapy in terms of health-related quality of life, but inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of pneumonia. This review supports current guidelines advocating long-acting beta-agonists as frontline therapy for COPD, with regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy as an adjunct in patients experiencing frequent exacerbations.

CD001036	Extended tip spatulas of various designs appear to be better for collecting endocervical cells than the commonly used Ayre spatula. The most effective combination appears to be the cytobrush with an extended tip spatula. The rate of detection of endocervical cells appears to be a valid and convenient surrogate for the ability to detect dyskaryosis and for adequate smear rates. The ability of the extended tip spatula with the cytobrush compared with the extended tip spatula alone to detect disease, needs to be evaluated in a trial.

CD000146	All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.	VNCH8M	NRT is an effective method of supporting smokers to quit. However, the evidence is limited by the number of studies and the heterogeneity of the interventions. There is a need for further research into the effectiveness of NRT in primary care settings.	SPNXTA	Tailoring the dose and duration of NRT is difficult, as is the method of delivering the drug. The short-term benefits of NNT are not clear. The long-term effects are not known.		
CD000972	There is currently no evidence of benefit from corticosteroids, but the small number of participants means it is difficult to exclude an effect on death in either direction.

CD004998	The small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. Transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation.

CD002873	There is no clear benefit of using b2-agonists in the management of recurrent wheeze in the first two years of life although there is conflicting evidence. At present, further studies should only be performed if the patient group can be clearly defined and there is a suitable outcome parameter capable of measuring a response.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of facemasks in the management of wheeze in infants. Further research is needed to determine the role of facembolism in the treatment of wheezing infants.

CD008765	In women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, ability to achieve surgery with complete cytoreduction (no visible residual disease) is associated with significant improvement in overall survival. However, in the absence of RCT evidence, it is not clear whether this is solely due to surgical effect or due to tumour biology. Indirect evidence would support surgery to achieve complete cytoreduction in selected women. The risks of major surgery need to be carefully balanced against potential benefits on a case-by-case basis.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of secondary cytoreduction in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the included trials was limited. The majority of trials were small and of poor quality. There is no evidence to support the use of surgery over cytoreduction for recurrent ovarian cancer. The one trial that was included in this review showed that surgery was associated with a reduction in overall mortality compared with complete cytoregery. However, the evidence is based on a small number of small trials with poor quality and the risk of bias was high. Further well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to assess the role of surgery versus cytorexia in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancers.

JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon-alpha in acute hepatitis C. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy of interferon-alpha in acute hepatitis C.		
CD000024	Since the last version of the review, neither of the two new relevant studies have provided additional information to change the conclusions. In patients with acute ischaemic stroke, immediate anticoagulant therapy is not associated with net short or long-term benefit. Treatment with anticoagulants reduced recurrent stroke, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, but increased bleeding risk. The data do not support the routine use of any the currently available anticoagulants in acute ischaemic stroke.	AQ85CE	Antiplatelet therapy with LMWH is effective in reducing the risk of major bleeding and major thrombotic complications in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of patients studied and the small sample size of the included trials. Further trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of LMWH in acute ischemic stroke.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of heparin in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.		
CD006655	This review has found evidence to support the role of laparoscopy for the management of early endometrial cancer. For presumed early stage primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, laparoscopy is associated with similar overall and disease-free survival. Laparoscopy is associated with reduced operative morbidity and hospital stay. There is no significant difference in severe post-operative morbidity between the two modalities.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether laparoscopic surgery is superior to abdominal hysterectomy in the treatment of early stage cancer.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer.		
CD002068	There is evidence to support the effectiveness of bisphosphonates in providing some pain relief for bone metastases. There is insufficient evidence to recommend bisphosphonates for immediate effect; as first line therapy; to define the most effective bisphosphonates or their relative effectiveness for different primary neoplasms. Bisphosphonates should be considered where analgesics and/or radiotherapy are inadequate for the management of painful bone metastases.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of bisphosphonates for the treatment of pain in patients with metastatic bone disease. The evidence is based on small trials and is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of bisphosphonates for the treatment of pain in patients with metastatic bone disease.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the available trials is insufficient to determine whether bisphosphonates are beneficial in the prevention of skeletal morbidity in women with breast cancer. There is a need for more well-designed, adequately powered, adequately-powered RCTs to determine bispharmacological interventions for the prevention and treatment of skeletal complications in women treated with hormone-based therapies.		
CD001066	Rutosides appear to help relieve the symptoms of varicose veins in late pregnancy. However, this finding is based on one small study (69 women) and there are not enough data presented in the study to assess its safety in pregnancy. It therefore cannot be routinely recommended. Reflexology appears to help improve symptoms for women with leg oedema, but again this is based on one small study (43 women). External compression stockings do not appear to have any advantages in reducing oedema.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether posturing or rest is more effective than rest in the treatment of women with pedal edema.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that rest, with or without medication, may be beneficial for pregnant women with leg oedema. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support the use of rest alone or in combination with other therapies.		
CD000220	Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes. The cure rate could probably be higher if more partners used the treatment.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether treatment of pregnant women with trichomoniasis reduces the risk of preterm birth or preterm birth.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of metronidazole for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis in preterm women. The results of this review suggest that metronidazole may be beneficial for the prevention of vaginal candidiasis in preterm women.		
CD007350	The results of one well designed study using lenalidomide did not show any statistically significant benefit over placebo. The use of thalidomide or lenalidomide for induction of remission in Crohn's disease is not recommended until data from a definitive study are available.	AQ85CE	Lenalidomide is an effective oral treatment for induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease. Its adverse events profile is similar to that of its parent compound, thalidomides, with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. However, the efficacy profile is significantly different from that of thalidomside.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of thalidomide for the treatment of active Crohn's disease.		
CD002964	Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of a short-term intervention for mothers to improve their infant's social development. The evidence is limited, however, and the results of this review suggest that short-term interventions may be effective in improving infant's social development.	AQ85CE	The review provides some evidence that parenting interventions can improve the quality of life of adolescent mothers and their infants. However, the evidence is limited and the results are heterogeneous. The review highlights the need for more research to be conducted in this area.		
CD005059	Epidural analgesia provides better pain relief (especially during movement) in the period up to three postoperative days. It reduces the duration of postoperative tracheal intubation by roughly half. The occurrence of prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation, myocardial infarction, gastric complications and renal complications was reduced by epidural analgesia. However, current evidence does not confirm the beneficial effect of epidural analgesia on postoperative mortality and other types of complications.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of epidural analgesia in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether epidural analgesia is beneficial or harmful for patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery.		
CD007404	We did not find RCTs evaluating the effects of primary surgical versus primary non-surgical interventions for central giant cell granuloma of the jaws. Although a number of non-surgical therapies have been proposed for treating central giant cell granuloma of the jaws, our review did not identify evidence from RCTs to support their use. More research is needed on this topic.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of calcitonin in the treatment of primary central nervous system (cns) granulomas. The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of calcitonin in the treatment of primary central nervous system granulomas.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of calcitonin for the treatment of CGG.		
CD003467	Due to lack of evidence it is impossible to determine whether amantadine is a safe and effective form of treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease.	SPNXTA	The available evidence does not support the use of amantadine as a treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of amantadine for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.		
CD003159	The clinical studies on nicergoline were carried out with diverse criteria and modalities of evaluation. Despite this, the 14 studies included in this review, have presented generally consistent results. Results of this meta-analysis provide some evidence of positive effects of nicergoline on cognition and behaviour and these effects are supported by an effect on clinical global impression. There was some evidence that there were increased risk of adverse effects associated with nicergoline. These results were obtained on older patients with mild to moderate cognitive and behavioural impairment of various clinical origins, including chronic cerebrovascular disorders and Alzheimer's dementia. The few studies specifically performed on patients with Alzheimer's disease were performed with too few people to give a definitive answer to the questions concerning the use of nicergoline for this form of dementia.This drug has not been evaluated using current diagnostic categories such as MCI or in association with therapeutic agents of different nature such as cholinesterase or antioxidant drugs.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ergogoline in the treatment of dementia. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of ergogoline in the treatment of dementia.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nicergoline for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia.		
CD001112	Caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly, for up to four hours, in people with asthma. People may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing, as caffeine ingestion could cause misinterpretation of the results. Drinking caffeinated coffee before taking exhaled nitric oxide measurements does not appear to affect the results of the test, but more studies are needed to confirm this.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of caffeine in the treatment of asthma. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of caffeine in the treatment of asthma.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of decaffeinated coffee for people with asthma.		
CD008454	There is currently no evidence for the use of NSAIDs in the secondary prevention of PD. Non-aspirin NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, may reduce the risk of developing PD. However, little is known of the effects of other individual drugs and at present no recommendations can be made regarding their use in primary prevention.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of stroke. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of stroke.	JB6Z8F	NSAIDs may reduce the risk of PD in people with Parkinson's disease, but the evidence is not strong enough to support or refute their use.		
CD007345	Prophylactic antibiotics reduce bacteriaemia and seem to prevent cholangitis and septicaemia in patients undergoing elective ERCP. In the subgroup of patients with uncomplicated ERCP, the effect of antibiotics may be less evident. Further research is required to determine whether antibiotics can be given during or after an ERCP if it becomes apparent that biliary obstruction cannot be relieved during that procedure.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis before ERCP.	PX7SGV	Theibiotic prophylaxis in patients with ERCP is associated with a reduction in bacteriologic failure. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of antibiotics in this population. Further research is needed.		
CD009461	Hysteroscopic myomectomy might increase the odds of clinical pregnancy in women with unexplained subfertility and submucous fibroids, but the evidence is at present not conclusive. The hysteroscopic removal of endometrial polyps suspected on ultrasound in women prior to IUI might increase the clinical pregnancy rate. More randomised studies are needed to substantiate the effectiveness of the hysteroscopic removal of suspected endometrial polyps, submucous fibroids, uterine septum or intrauterine adhesions in women with unexplained subfertility or prior to IUI, IVF or ICSI.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine the role of fibroids in fertility. [Note: The four citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the reviews once assessed.]	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of hysteroscopic polyps in the treatment of infrequent unexplained infertility. Further research is needed to determine whether hysteroscopic surgery is beneficial or harmful.		
CD009308	In conclusion, in this Cochrane systematic review we found that that the effects of family-based prevention interventions are small but generally consistent and also persistent into the medium- to longer-term.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any intervention to prevent the uptake of alcohol and drug use by young people.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that family interventions are effective in reducing the use of illicit drug use among youth aged 15 years and younger. However, the evidence is limited and the quality of the evidence was variable. There is a need for more research to assess the effectiveness of family interventions for drug use prevention among youth ages 15 years to 25 years.		
CD004487	Paracetamol is a safe, effective drug for the treatment of postoperative pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.	VNCH8M	Acetaminophen 1000 mg is an effective analgesic for moderate to severe postoperative pain. Adverse events are less frequent but more frequent with paracetamol 500 mg. Adverse events are more frequent with acetaminophen 1000 mg. Adverse events are more frequent with paracetamol 500 mg. Adverse events are more frequent with acetaminophen 1000 mg.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that paracetamol is an effective analgesic for moderate to severe postoperative pain. The effect of paracetamusol on pain relief is similar to that of other commonly used analgesics such as ibuprofen, naproxen, napoleonxime, naprinol, naprofen and naproxens.		
CD001342	For the secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke after TIA or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that vitamin K antagonists in any dose are not more efficacious than antiplatelet therapy and that medium and high intensity anticoagulation leads to a significant increase in major bleeding complications.	SPNXTA	Oral anticoagulants are more effective than aspirin in the prevention of transient ischaemic stroke or RIND. However, there is no evidence to support the use of these drugs in the treatment of patients with non-valuable ischaemia.	AQ85CE	Oral anticoagulants are effective in preventing vascular events in patients with transient ischaemic stroke and minor ischaemia. However, the evidence is limited. The effect of oral anticoagenics on mortality and major vascular events is unknown.		
CD001539	The provision of recordings or summaries of key consultations may benefit most adults with cancer. Although more research is needed to improve our understanding of these interventions, most patients find them very useful. Practitioners should consider offering people recordings or written summaries of their consultations	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of audio-visual interventions in the management of patients with cancer.	SPNXTA	There is limited evidence to support the use of audio-taped consultations to enhance the recall of patients and their clinicians regarding clinical information. There is some evidence that tapes may be more effective than standardised consultations in improving recall of information given in a clinical trial. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the widespread use of tapes in clinical practice.		
CD007345	Prophylactic antibiotics reduce bacteriaemia and seem to prevent cholangitis and septicaemia in patients undergoing elective ERCP. In the subgroup of patients with uncomplicated ERCP, the effect of antibiotics may be less evident. Further research is required to determine whether antibiotics can be given during or after an ERCP if it becomes apparent that biliary obstruction cannot be relieved during that procedure.	AQ85CE	Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the risk of ERCP-induced cholangitis and the need for further surgery in patients with ERCCP-induced complications.	SPNXTA	Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces the risk of pancreatitis after ERCP, but the absolute risk is not significant.		
CD000254	People with AMD may experience delay in progression of the disease with antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation. This finding is drawn from one large trial conducted in a relatively well-nourished American population. The generalisability of these findings to other populations is not known. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects. A systematic review of the evidence on harms of vitamin supplements is needed.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antioxidant supplements in the treatment of AMD. Further research is needed.	SPNXTA	There is currently no evidence to support the use of antioxidant supplements in the treatment of AMD. There is evidence of a short-term benefit in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and contrast sensitivity in people with atrophic AMD.		
CD001266	Bronchodilators do not improve oxygen saturation, do not reduce hospital admission after outpatient treatment, do not shorten the duration of hospitalization and do not reduce the time to resolution of illness at home. The small improvements in clinical scores for outpatients must be weighed against the costs and adverse effects of bronchodilators.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nebulised albutamol in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of nebulised albuterol in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis.		
CD004571	There is no evidence to show a significant beneficial effect of calcium antagonists on muscle function in DMD.

The is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of patients with nuchenne muscular dystrophy.		
CD002959	Available evidence supports the implementation of immunisation practices on women of childbearing age or pregnant women in communities with similar, or higher, levels of risk of neonatal tetanus, to the two study sites. More information is needed on possible interference of vaccination by malaria chemoprophylaxis on the roles of malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency, and on the quality of tetanus toxoid production and storage.	SPNXTA	Treatment of neonatal tetanus with an aluminium-adsorbed tetanus-diptheria toxoid is associated with a reduction in the risk of neonatorum death and serious adverse events.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that tetanus vaccination reduces neonatal mortality. The is no evidence that tetanus vaccination reduces neonatal mortality in neonates. The is no evidence that tetanus vaccination reduces neonatal mortality in neonates. The is no evidence that tetanus vaccination reduces neonatal mortality in neonates.		
CD003700	The evidence does not suggest a significant reduction in mortality, measures of morbidity, nor an effect on the clinical course of pneumonia with vitamin A adjunctive treatment in children with non-measles pneumonia. However, not all studies measured all outcomes, which limited the number of studies that could be incorporated into the meta-analyses, so that there may have been a lack of statistical power to detect statistically significant differences.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin supplementation in children admitted to hospital for pneumonia. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin supplementation in children admitted for pneumonia.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of vitamin A as an adjunct to standard treatment of pneumonia in children.		
CD007693	There should be a balanced consideration between the benefits of topical fluorides in caries prevention and the risk of the development of fluorosis. Most of the available evidence focuses on mild fluorosis. There is weak unreliable evidence that starting the use of fluoride toothpaste in children under 12 months of age may be associated with an increased risk of fluorosis. The evidence for its use between the age of 12 and 24 months is equivocal. If the risk of fluorosis is of concern, the fluoride level of toothpaste for young children (under 6 years of age) is recommended to be lower than 1000 parts per million (ppm). More evidence with low risk of bias is needed. Future trials assessing the effectiveness of different types of topical fluorides (including toothpastes, gels, varnishes and mouthrinses) or different concentrations or both should ensure that they include an adequate follow-up period in order to collect data on potential fluorosis. As it is unethical to propose RCTs to assess fluorosis itself, it is acknowledged that further observational studies will be undertaken in this area. However, attention needs to be given to the choice of study design, bearing in mind that prospective, controlled studies will be less susceptible to bias than retrospective and/or uncontrolled studies.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether fluoride toothpaste is effective in preventing dental fluorosis. The is insufficient evidence to determine whether fluoride toothpaste is effective in preventing dental fluorosis in children. The research is needed to determine whether fluoride toothpaste is effective in preventing dental fluorosis in children.	VNCH8M	Fluoride toothpaste is a common preventative intervention for fluorosis. However, the evidence from the included studies was limited by the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the studies. The results of this review suggest that there is a possible association between fluoride toothpaste use and fluorosis.		
CD003700	The evidence does not suggest a significant reduction in mortality, measures of morbidity, nor an effect on the clinical course of pneumonia with vitamin A adjunctive treatment in children with non-measles pneumonia. However, not all studies measured all outcomes, which limited the number of studies that could be incorporated into the meta-analyses, so that there may have been a lack of statistical power to detect statistically significant differences.

SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin A in children with non-measles pneumonia.		
CD004376	There is platinum level evidence that land-based therapeutic exercise has at least short term benefit in terms of reduced knee pain and improved physical function for people with knee OA. The magnitude of the treatment effect would be considered small, but comparable to estimates reported for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.	SPNXTA	Moderate intensity, low intensity, and continuous aerobic exercise programs appear to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in people with knee OA.	VNCH8M	Physical therapy is effective for the treatment of knee OA. Physical therapy is also effective for the treatment of hip OA. Physical therapy is also effective for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis of the knee. Physical therapy is also effective for the treatment of hip OA.		
CD002139	At the outset of this meta-analysis there was considerable pessimism about the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. These results offer hope of progress and suggest that chemotherapy may have a role in treating this disease.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that chemotherapy is superior to radiotherapy or surgery for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The is no evidence that chemotherapy is superior to radiotherapy or surgery for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The is no evidence that chemotherapy is superior to radiotherapy or surgery for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.	VNCH8M	Adjuvant chemotherapy improves overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced NSCLC. However, the effect on overall survival is small and the overall quality of life is low.		
CD005522	Tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol decreases pain intensity, produces symptom relief and improves function, but these benefits are small. Adverse events, although reversible and not life threatening, often cause participants to stop taking the medication and could limit tramadol or tramadol plus paracetamol usefulness.	AQ85CE	Tramadol is an effective analgesic for moderate to severe OA, providing pain relief at least equivalent to commonly used NSAIDs, with a lower incidence of adverse events. The addition of tramadol to commonly prescribed NSAIDs provides pain relief equivalent to about half of those treated with placebo, and comparable to about one-third of those given with placebo.	VNCH8M	Tramadol is an effective analgesic for moderate to severe OA. Its adverse effects are similar to those of other NSAIDs.		
CD004115	Rectal 5-ASA should be considered a first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderately active distal UC. The optimal total daily dose and dose frequency of 5-ASA remain to be determined. Future research should define differences in efficacy among patient subgroups defined by proximal disease margin and disease activity. There is a strong need for consensus standardization of outcome measurements for clinical trials in ulcerative colitis.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of 5-ASA enemas for the treatment of patients with active distal ulcerative colitis.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the included trials was limited. The small number of patients and the small sample sizes of the included studies limit the generalisability of the findings. The results suggest that pentasa is an effective treatment for mild to moderate proctosigmoiditis.		
CD008361	We could not find convincing evidence that NBI is significantly better than high definition WLC for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas. We found evidence that NBI might be better than standard definition WLC and equal to high definition WLC for detection the patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of narrow-band imaging over white light for colonoscopy.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of NBI for colonoscopy.		
CD009274	Topical steroid is a beneficial treatment for CRS without polyps and the adverse effects are minor. It may be included in a comprehensive treatment of CRS without polyps. Direct delivery of steroid to the sinuses may bring more beneficial effect. Further studies comparing different topical drug delivery methods to the sinuses, with appropriate treatment duration (longer than 12 weeks), are required.	SPNXTA	There is currently no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of CRS. Further large randomised trials are needed to determine the role of systemic steroids in CRS, and whether they are beneficial or harmful.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.		
CD003096	The data are too few to support the use of hydration as a specific treatment for women presenting with preterm labour. The two small studies available do not show any advantage of hydration compared to bed rest alone. Intravenous hydration does not seem to be beneficial, even during the period of evaluation soon after admission, in women with preterm labour. Women with evidence of dehydration may, however, benefit from the intervention.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of tocolysis for women with preterm labour.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of intravenous hydration for women with preterm labour.		
CD002055	There is no evidence from randomised trials to support the routine use of early volume expansion in very preterm infants without cardiovascular compromise. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether infants with cardiovascular compromise benefit from volume expansion. There is insufficient evidence to determine what type of volume expansion should be used in preterm infants (if at all) or to determine the benefit of using early red cell transfusions. The significance of the finding of a significant increase in blood pressure in hypotensive preterm infants in one trial comparing albumin and saline is unclear, but the overall meta-analyses found no other significant clinical benefit in using albumin compared to saline.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of albumin for the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of albumin for the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of albumin-bolus therapy for the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal dose, volume and route of administration of albumin-bolus therapy for the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants.		
CD005950	There is limited evidence to suggest that MP in combination with other rehabilitation treatment appears to be beneficial in improving upper extremity function after stroke, as compared with other rehabilitation treatment without MP. Evidence regarding improvement in motor recovery and quality of movement is less clear. There is no clear pattern regarding the ideal dosage of MP required to improve outcomes. Further studies are required to evaluate the effect of MP on time post stroke, volume of MP that is required to affect the outcomes and whether improvement is maintained long-term. Numerous large ongoing studies will soon improve the evidence base.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of mental practice as a treatment for stroke. Further research is required.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of occupational therapy as a treatment for upper limb function after stroke. Further research is needed to determine the optimal type and duration of occupational training, the optimal intensity and duration, and the optimal duration of such training.		
CD002815	Considering the small number of patients examined, the methodological flaws in many of the studies and the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of any given form of physiotherapy over another in Parkinson's disease. Another Cochrane review, Physiotherapy for patients with Parkinson's Disease, found that there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of physiotherapy compared to no physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease.  A wide range of physiotherapy approaches were used in these studies and a survey of UK physiotherapists confirmed that they also use an eclectic combination of techniques in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Plant 1999). Therefore a consensus must be found as to 'best practice' physiotherapy for Parkinson's disease. The efficacy of 'standard' physiotherapy should be proved first before examining variations in physiotherapy methods. Therefore large well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to judge the effect of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. After this large RCTs are needed to demonstrate the most effective form of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients, carers, physiotherapists and physicians should be chosen and the patients monitored for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any effect. The trials should be reported according to CONSORT guidelines (CONSORT 1996).	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of RAS in the rehabilitation of people with Parkinson's disease.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of music-based interventions for people with idiopathic myasthenia gravis. The research should focus on the use of music-based interventions for people with idiopathic myasthenia gravis.

CD002892	Limited evidence is available for the effectiveness of interventions to reduce stress levels in healthcare workers. Larger and better quality trials are needed.	VNCH8M	There is some evidence that psychological training can reduce burnout in health care workers. However, the evidence is not strong and the results need to be interpreted with caution.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that psychological training can reduce burnout. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support or refute the use of psychological training in the management of health care workers. More research is needed on the effects of psychological interventions on professional stress and burnout, and on how they are used in different settings.		
CD007610	There is no high-quality research evidence evaluating complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration and insufficient evidence of benefit.	SPNXTA	There is evidence that self-foot care education by health professionals reduces the incidence of diabetic foot complications in patients with diabetes. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of self-reported self-care measures in clinical practice.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of foot care interventions for people with diabetes.		
CD004751	In women undergoing surgery for benign ovarian tumours, laparoscopy was associated with a reduction in fever, urinary tract infection, postoperative complications, postoperative pain, number of days in hospital, and total cost. These findings should be interpreted with caution since only a small number of studies were identified. These included a total of only 769 women and not all of the important outcomes were reported in each study.	SPNXTA	The laparoscopic approach appears to be as effective as the open surgical approach in the treatment of benign ovarian cysts. However, there is a need for further research.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of laparoscopy for the management of benign adnexal cysts.		
CD008871	Low-dose rate brachytherapy did not reduce biochemical recurrence-free survival versus radical prostatectomy at 5 years. For short-term severe adverse events, low-dose rate brachytherapy was significantly more favorable for urinary incontinence, but radical prostatectomy was significantly more favorable for urinary irritation. Evidence is based on one RCT with high risk of bias.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of brachytherapy for patients with low-risk prostatic cancer.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of brastatic therapy for patients with prostate cancer.

PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of topical corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic sinusitis.		
CD003412	Overall there has been very little good quality research on treatments for BCC. Most trials have only evaluated BCCs in low risk locations. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments with surgery showing the lowest failure rates. Although cosmetic outcomes appear good with PDT, long-term follow-up data are needed. Other treatments might have some use but few have been compared to surgery. An ongoing study comparing imiquimod to surgery should clarify whether imiquimod is a useful option.	AQ85CE	Imiquimod 5% cream appears to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with Basal cell carcinoma. However, the evidence is based on a small number of patients and the quality of the evidence was poor. The quality of evidence for other topical treatments was poor, and the number of participants in the included trials was small. There is a need for more RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of topical imiquimid 5% in the management of Basal Cell carcinoma, and to compare it with other topical therapies.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that topical interferon is more effective than surgery for the treatment of superficial BCC. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of this cream over other treatments.		
CD002113	There was insufficient evidence to reach firm conclusions for practice. There was suggestive evidence of short-term benefit from prompted voiding, but longer-term effects are not known, and prompted voiding has significant resource implications.	SPNXTA	There is evidence that prompted voiding reduces urinary incontinence in nursing home residents. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support or refute the effectiveness of this intervention.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of prompted voiding in the management of urinary incontinence in nursing home residents.		
CD008890	Since no RCTs, quasi-randomised trials or CCTs in which only the use of intracystic bleomycin differed between the treatment groups in the treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas in children, no definitive conclusions could be made about the effects of intracystic bleomycin in these patients. Only one low-power RCT comparing intracystic bleomycin with intracystic 32P treatment was available, but no definitive conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of these agents in children with cystic craniopharyngiomas. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to give recommendations for the use of intracystic bleomycin in the treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas in children. High quality RCTs are needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of bleomycin for the treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence to support the use of intracystic chemotherapy in patients with cystic craniopharyngiomas.		
CD002255	When tocolysis is indicated for women in preterm labour, calcium channel blockers are preferable to other tocolytic agents compared, mainly betamimetics. Further research should address the effects of different dosage regimens and formulations of calcium channel blockers on maternal and neonatal outcomes. [Note: The 39 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	SPNXTA	Corticosteroids are an effective tocolytic agent for the treatment of threatened preterm labour. Nifedipine and ritodrine have not been rigorously evaluated for their role in preventing preterm birth.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of nifedipine as an alternative to ritodrine in the management of preterm labour.		
CD009755	In keeping with previous World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations everything possible should be done to promote and support adequate dietary intake of micronutrients, while recognising that this may not be sufficient to correct specific micronutrient deficiencies in all HIV-infected individuals. Specific recommendations for pregnant and lactating women infected with HIV would be to include the provision of multivitamin supplements in single RDA formulations during the antenatal period and at least for 6 weeks post-partum, especially for women who are breast-feeding. There is no conclusive evidence to provide stand-alone zinc or selenium supplementation to HIV-infected pregnant and lactating women. Micronutrient supplementation should not be used as a substitute for provision of recommended antiretroviral medication for preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV and treating maternal HIV infection when this is recommended. Further trials of single supplements are required to build the evidence base. The long-term clinical benefits, adverse effects, and optimal formulation of multiple micronutrient supplements require further investigation in pregnant women at different stages of HIV infection.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the routine use of multivitamin supplements for women with HIV status.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine supplementation of HIV-infected pregnant women with vitamin A for reducing pregnancy or neonatal mortality.		
CD002815	Considering the small number of patients examined, the methodological flaws in many of the studies and the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of any given form of physiotherapy over another in Parkinson's disease. Another Cochrane review, Physiotherapy for patients with Parkinson's Disease, found that there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of physiotherapy compared to no physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease.  A wide range of physiotherapy approaches were used in these studies and a survey of UK physiotherapists confirmed that they also use an eclectic combination of techniques in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Plant 1999). Therefore a consensus must be found as to 'best practice' physiotherapy for Parkinson's disease. The efficacy of 'standard' physiotherapy should be proved first before examining variations in physiotherapy methods. Therefore large well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to judge the effect of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. After this large RCTs are needed to demonstrate the most effective form of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients, carers, physiotherapists and physicians should be chosen and the patients monitored for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any effect. The trials should be reported according to CONSORT guidelines (CONSORT 1996).	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of RAS in the rehabilitation of people with Parkinson's disease.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of RAS in the rehabilitation of people with PD.		
CD003700	The evidence does not suggest a significant reduction in mortality, measures of morbidity, nor an effect on the clinical course of pneumonia with vitamin A adjunctive treatment in children with non-measles pneumonia. However, not all studies measured all outcomes, which limited the number of studies that could be incorporated into the meta-analyses, so that there may have been a lack of statistical power to detect statistically significant differences.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of vitamin A as an adjunct to standard treatment of pneumonia in children.	JB6Z8F	There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of vitamin A supplementation in the treatment of pneumonia in children.		
CD008586	There is a lack of robust, randomised, controlled evidence to support the choice of antiepileptic drug for the treatment of seizures in adults with brain tumours. While some authors support the use of non enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, reliable, comparative evidence to provide clinical justification for this is limited. There is a need for further large, randomised, controlled trials in this area.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of phenytoin as a monotherapy for the treatment of tumor-related seizures in patients with cancer.	AQ85CE	Levetiracetam is a relatively safe and well tolerated monotherapy drug for the treatment of patients with glioma-related seizures. Its use is associated with a lower risk of adverse events than phenytoin, but a higher risk of serious adverse events.		
CD005190	Results indicate that PAN may be an effective treatment of the mild to moderate alcoholic withdrawal state. The rapidity of the therapeutic effect of PAN therapy coupled with the minimal sedative requirements, may enable patients to enter the psychological treatment phase more quickly than those on sedative regimens, accelerating the patients recovery. Our review does not provide strong evidence due to the small sample sizes of the included trials. Neither does the review indicate any causes for concern that PAN is more harmful than the benzodiazepines. Clinicians wishing to use PAN may initially wish to do so within trial settings. Further high quality trials should be done to confirm these findings and to investigate whether the PAN therapy has fewer adverse effects than other treatments for the alcohol withdrawal states. Studies to investigate the possible cost-effectiveness of PAN by reducing costly hospital admissions and decreasing post administration supervision also need to be performed.	AQ85CE	Nitrous oxide is an effective treatment for acute alcoholic withdrawal symptoms. Its use is associated with fewer adverse effects than placebo, but more vomiting.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of alcoholic withdrawal.		
CD008871	Low-dose rate brachytherapy did not reduce biochemical recurrence-free survival versus radical prostatectomy at 5 years. For short-term severe adverse events, low-dose rate brachytherapy was significantly more favorable for urinary incontinence, but radical prostatectomy was significantly more favorable for urinary irritation. Evidence is based on one RCT with high risk of bias.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether radical retropubic prostatectomy is superior to brachytherapy for the treatment of low-risk CaP.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of radical retropubic prostatectomy for the treatment of low-risk CaP.		
CD006170	The most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. Low cost interventions including early initiation when not feeding at the breast, relaxation, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. Small sample sizes, large standard deviations, small number of studies reviewed, and the diversity of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the specific settings.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of breast pumps for women who wish to continue breastfeeding their infants. Further research is needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any particular pump type or method for breast milk production in preterm infants. Further research is required to determine the optimal pump type and method for breast milk production in preterm infants.		
CD005959	The available evidence shows that intramedullary nailing is associated with an increased risk of shoulder impingement, with a related increase in restriction of shoulder movement and need for removal of metalwork. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there were any other important differences, including in functional outcome, between dynamic compression plating and locked intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fractures.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of intramedullary nails for the treatment of acute humeral shaft fractures.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the surgical techniques used in the treatment of humerus fractures. Further research is needed.		
CD001055	Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy reduce the proportion of women who continue to smoke in late pregnancy, and reduce low birthweight and preterm birth. Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy need to be implemented in all maternity care settings. Given the difficulty many pregnant women addicted to tobacco have quitting during pregnancy, population-based measures to reduce smoking and social inequalities should be supported.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation during pregnancy.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women. The is insufficient evidence to determine whether smoking cessation interventions are effective in reducing smoking rates in the first trimester of pregnancy.		
CD000345	Pretreatment with glucocorticosteroids before treatment with alfa interferon in patients with hepatitis B 'e' antigen positive chronic hepatitis B may be more effective than treatment with alfa interferon alone with regard to loss of hepatitis B 'e' antigen and hepatitis B virus DNA, but evidence for effect on clinical outcomes is lacking.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon-alpha for chronic hepatitis B.	VNCH8M	Interferon is an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B. However, the evidence is limited. There is no evidence of benefit from interferon alone or with or without steroid pretreatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B.		
CD005181	Well designed RCTs, evaluating a high number of patients were included in the review. Recombinant IFN beta does not prevent the development of permanent physical disability in SPMS. We were unable to verify the effect on cognitive function for the lack of comparable data. This treatment significantly reduces the risk of relapse and of short -term relapse-related disability. Overall, these results show that IFNs' anti-inflammatory effect is unable to retard progression, when established. In the future, no new RCTs for IFNs versus placebo in SPMS will probably be undertaken, because research is now focusing on innovative drugs. We believe that this review gives conclusive evidence on the clinical efficacy of IFNs versus placebo in SPMS.	SPNXTA	Interferon beta has a beneficial effect on the MSFC Z-score and on the Regional Functional Status Scale in SPMS. However, there is no evidence of benefit on other important outcomes such as quality of life and disability.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon beta-1b for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. The results of this review suggest that interferon beta-1b may be effective in reducing relapses in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.		
CD004943	The quality of the evidence was poor, but the findings suggest that the combination of antacids plus H2 antagonists was more effective than no intervention, and superior to antacids alone in preventing low gastric pH. However, none of the studies assessed potential adverse effects or substantive clinical outcomes. These findings are relevant for all women undergoing caesarean section under general anaesthesia.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral antisecretory agents for caesarean section in women undergoing anaesthesia.	VNCH8M	Cimetidine is effective in reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonitis in women undergoing elective caesarean section. Adverse events were not reported.		
CD004081	Our systematic review establishes the effectiveness of topical and systemic lidocaine for the prevention of postoperative sore throat resulting from intubation. The risk and severity of postoperative sore throat tended to be reduced. The effect size of lidocaine appeared to be affected by drug concentration and route of administration; management of cuff pressure during anaesthesia; the included population; and the type of outcome measured.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of lidocaine in endotracheal intubation.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of lidocaine to reduce the incidence of sore throat after endotracheal intubation. There is a need for further research.		
CD008012	Psychological interventions and pharmacological interventions with SSRIs may have a small yet clinically meaningful effect on depression outcomes in CAD patients. No beneficial effects on the reduction of mortality rates and cardiac events were found. Overall, however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of high quality trials per outcome and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants in patients with depression after surgery. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants in patients with depression after surgery. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants in patients with depression after surgery.	VNCH8M	SSRIs are effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MI. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether SSRIs are effective in reducing mortality or morbidity in patients with MI.		
CD003427	Prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous sickle cell disease, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the two included trials is insufficient to determine whether the use of pneumococcal vaccine in children with sickle cell disease prevents the development of serotype-specific IgG antibodies. The use of vaccine in this population is associated with a reduction in the risk of severe adverse events.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of oral penicillin in preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell anemia.		
CD003042	There are insufficient studies which compare differing methods of chest drain clearance to support or refute the relative efficacy of the various methods in preventing cardiac tamponade. Nor can the need to manipulate chest drains be supported or refuted by results from RCTs.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of either milking or stripping of chest tubes in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute routine chest tube removal and milking.		
CD001275	There is no evidence of benefit of ultrasound therapy in the treatment of pressure ulcers. However, the possibility of beneficial or harmful effect cannot be ruled out due to the small number of trials, some with methodological limitations and small numbers of participants. Further research is needed.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ultrasound for the treatment of pressure ulcers in people with spinal cord injury.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether laser therapy is more effective than other treatments for the treatment of pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury.		
CD006655	This review has found evidence to support the role of laparoscopy for the management of early endometrial cancer. For presumed early stage primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, laparoscopy is associated with similar overall and disease-free survival. Laparoscopy is associated with reduced operative morbidity and hospital stay. There is no significant difference in severe post-operative morbidity between the two modalities.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that laparoscopic surgery is superior to conventional surgery for early stage endometrial cancer. The is some evidence that laparoscopic surgery is associated with a lower complication rate. The is no evidence that laparoscopic surgery is superior to conventional surgery for early stage endometrial cancer. The is no evidence that laparoscopic surgery is superior to conventional surgery for early stage endometrial cancer.	SPNXTA	The laparotomy approach to early stage endometrial cancer is associated with significantly longer hospital stay and a lower risk of major complications compared with the traditional abdominal approach. However, there is no evidence of a significant difference in overall survival or perioperative morbidity.		
CD000123	Lipid-lowering therapy is effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in people with PAD. It may also improve local symptoms. Until further evidence on the relative effectiveness of different lipid-lowering agents is available, use of a statin in people with PAD and a blood cholesterol level ≥ 3.5 mmol/litre is most indicated.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs for the treatment of intermittent claudication.	VNCH8M	Glycosaminoglycan s may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to severe atherosclerosis. However, the evidence is limited.		
CD001069	Sucrose is safe and effective for reducing procedural pain from single events. An optimal dose could not be identified due to inconsistency in effective sucrose dosage among studies. Further investigation on repeated administration of sucrose in neonates and the use of sucrose in combination with other non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions is needed. Sucrose use in extremely preterm, unstable, ventilated (or a combination of these) neonates needs to be addressed. Additional research is needed to determine the minimally effective dose of sucrose during a single painful procedure and the effect of repeated sucrose administration on immediate (pain intensity) and long-term (neurodevelopmental) outcomes.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of sucrose for pain relief in neonates.	VNCH8M	Sucrose, when used in combination with other analgesic interventions, reduces pain response in term infants undergoing painful procedures.		
CD007617	There is evidence that supportive interventions may help reduce caregivers' psychological distress. These findings suggest that practitioners should enquire about the concerns of caregivers and should consider that they may benefit from additional support. There is, however, a need for further research to explore the benefits identified, and to assess the interventions' effects on physical health, and potential harms. Trials need to report their methods fully.	VNCH8M	There is some evidence that interventions to improve the psychological health of family caregivers of patients with cancer can be effective. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend a specific type of intervention.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of family-based interventions in the management of cancer.		
CD001342	For the secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke after TIA or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that vitamin K antagonists in any dose are not more efficacious than antiplatelet therapy and that medium and high intensity anticoagulation leads to a significant increase in major bleeding complications.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of aspirin or warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular coronary artery disease. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of either drug for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular coronary artery disease.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of anticoagulants over aspirin for secondary prevention after TIA or RIND.		
CD007474	There is still lack of strong evidence for an optimal dose for clinical practice. The quality of trials suggests that an over estimate of effect is likely and we think this is most probably for the mid-range doses. One such dose (standard-lower dose range, 4-<6 mg/day) does seem optimal for clinical response and adverse effects. Weak evidence suggests that low doses (≧2-<4 mg/day) may be of value for people in their first episode of illness. High doses (≧10 mg/day) did not confer any advantage over any other dose ranges and caused more adverse effects, especially for movement disorders. Ultra low dose (<2 mg/day) seemed useless. We advise the use of dosages from low dose to standard-lower dose for different kinds of individual patients. Future trials should focus on specific populations, e.g. those in their first episode, with acute exacerbation, in relapse or refractory to treatment, and should also test the optimal dose of risperidone over a longer period of time and in the community.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenia. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenia.		
CD003421	These results suggest that calcium channel blockers given in the peri-operative period may reduce the incidence of ATN post-transplantation. The result should be treated with caution due to the heterogeneity of the trials which made comparison of studies and pooling of data difficult.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of calcium antagonists in patients undergoing cadaveric kidney transplantation.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium antagonists in the treatment of CKD graft recipients.		
CD005137	In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either full or partial patching for the treatment of amblyopia. Further trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment for amblyopia.	SPNXTA	Optimal refractive correction improves amblyopic visual acuity compared with conventional patching. Optimal visual correction is not associated with improvement in amblyopia.

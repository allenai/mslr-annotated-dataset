review_id	target	sys_a	A	sys_b	B	Which of A or B more accurately reflects the content of the target summary? (Choices: A, B, Neither)	Notes
CD004277	There is limited evidence that cyclosporine is more effective than standard treatment alone for severe ulcerative colitis. The relatively quick response makes the short-term use of cyclosporine potentially attractive, but the long-term benefit is unclear, when adverse events such as cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity may become more obvious. There is a need for additional research on quality of life, costs and long-term results from cyclosporine therapy in severe ulcerative colitis.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cyclosporine as a single treatment for UC.	SPNXTA	Intravenous cyclosporine is an effective and safe alternative to glucocorticosteroids in patients with UC who have not responded to intravenous corticosteroid therapy.	B	This was a tough one; B overstates the take away (confidently asserting that it is effective and safe, without the "limited evidence" caveat in the reference), but A says there is "insufficient evidence" even though the reference concludes that there is, in fact, (limited) evidence for efficacy. I think this is probably the worse error.
CD002892	Limited evidence is available for the effectiveness of interventions to reduce stress levels in healthcare workers. Larger and better quality trials are needed.	VNCH8M	There is some evidence that psychological training can reduce burnout in health care workers. However, the evidence is not strong and the results need to be interpreted with caution.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that psychological training can reduce burnout. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support or refute the use of psychological training in the management of health care workers. More research is needed on the effects of psychological interventions on professional stress and burnout, and on how they are used in different settings.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD003026	Only one RCT of treatment for amphetamine psychosis has been published. Outcomes from this trial indicate that antipsychotic medications effectively reduce symptoms of amphetamine psychosis, the newer generation and more expensive antipsychotic medication, olanzapine, demonstrates significantly better tolerability than the more affordable and commonly used medication, haloperidol. There are other two studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. The results of these two studies show that agitation and some psychotic symptoms may be abated within an hour after antipsychotic injection.  Whether this limited evidence can be applied for amphetamine psychotic patients is not yet known.  The medications that should be further investigate are conventional antipsychotics, newer antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. However, naturalistic studies of amphetamine psychotic symptoms and the prevalence of relapse to psychosis in the presence of amphetamine, are also crucial for advising the development of study designs appropriate for further treatment studies of amphetamine psychosis.	SPNXTA	Olanzapine may be effective in the short-term treatment of amphetamine psychosis. However, long-term data are not available and further trials are required to confirm or refute these findings.	PX7SGV	Therelanzapine is an effective treatment for amphetamine psychosis. However, there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an adjunct to haloperidol. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment for this condition.	A	
CD002964	Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of videotape as a means of improving parenting skills among adolescents.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of a short-term intervention for mothers to improve their infant's social development. The evidence is limited, however, and the results of this review suggest that short-term interventions may be effective in improving infant's social development.	A	Both wrong! BUT B contradicts itself, so
CD000405	Evidence suggests that oral antibiotics reduce the incidence of NEC in low birth weight infants. However concerns about adverse outcomes persist, particularly related to the development of resistant bacteria. To address this question further, a large trial would be required with a sample size sufficient to examine all the important benefits and harms. Adverse outcomes associated with infection should be evaluated, and microbiological studies looking for the development of resistant bacteria should be undertaken	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of oral vancomycin in the prevention of NEC in preterm or very low birthweight infants.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral gentamicin for the prevention of enterocolitis in preterm infants. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of oral gentamicin for the prevention of enterocolitis in preterm infants.	A	Again both are wrong, but B does a weird self-repetition thing so I'm going with A
CD001691	Postnatal administration of phenobarbital cannot be recommended as prophylaxis to prevent IVH in preterm infants and is associated with an increased need for mechanical ventilation.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of prophylactic phenobarbital for the prevention of VLBW in preterm infants.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of early anticonvulsant treatment of preterm infants with suspected early (intraventricular haemorrhage) to prevent late (cephalic encephalopathy) or late (neurodevelopmental abnormalities) manifestations of hypoxic-ischemic encomia.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD002231	Based on one low quality trial, the medicinal herb 'Jianpi Wenshen recipe' may have an antiviral activity in asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B virus. However, rigorous randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed before herbs should be used for this condition.	SPNXTA	The efficacy of Phyllanthus amarus for the treatment of asymptomatic hepatitis B virus carriers remains unclear. The plant appears to be of no benefit in preventing the spread of hepatitis B viruses to other populations.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether Phyllanthus amarus is effective in the eradication of hepatitis B virus.	B	
CD008120	We identified eligible trials on quetiapine, risperidone and olanzapine. The available data on olanzapine and risperidone are too limited to draw any conclusions. Monotherapy with quetiapine seems to be efficacious in reducing symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder and this effect may be similar to that of antidepressants. However, quetiapine's efficacy must be weighed against its lower tolerability.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of quetiapine as a treatment for GAD.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of quetiapine as an adjunctive treatment for patients with generalized anxiety disorder. The results suggest that quetiapine may be more effective than placebo in the short-term. The results of this review suggest that quetiapine may be more effective than placebo in the long-term.	A	Again both are wrong; but again here B is internally inconsistent so I am selecting A.
CD001431	New for this updated review is evidence that: decision aids with explicit values clarification exercises improve informed values-based choices; decision aids appear to have a positive effect on patient-practitioner communication; and decision aids have a variable effect on length of consultation. Consistent with findings from the previous review, which had included studies up to 2006: decision aids increase people's involvement, and improve knowledge and realistic perception of outcomes; however, the size of the effect varies across studies. Decision aids have a variable effect on choices. They reduce the choice of discretionary surgery and have no apparent adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction. The effects on adherence with the chosen option, patient-practitioner communication, cost-effectiveness, and use with developing and/or lower literacy populations need further evaluation. Little is known about the degree of detail that decision aids need in order to have positive effects on attributes of the decision or decision-making process.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of computerised decision aids for prostate cancer screening.	AQ85CE	There is some evidence that providing genetic testing information to women with family history of breast cancer reduces the risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer, but the evidence is not strong enough to recommend routine screening for this condition. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of screening information to reduce the risk for other types of cancer.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	I couldn't really tell here w/o more info. A is wrong in general but at least seems to get the intervention right; B is maybe correct but the intervention seems a bit weird (unclear based on the reference whether the decision aid includes genetic testing info I guess)
CD006505	Inactivated VZV vaccine might reduce zoster severity in adult SCT recipients. Inactivated influenza vaccine might reduce respiratory infections and hospitalization in adults with multiple myeloma or children with leukemia or lymphoma. However, the quality of evidence is low. Local adverse effects occur frequently. Further high-quality RCTs are needed.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that influenza vaccination improves the immune response in children with oncohematological malignancies. The data suggest that influenza vaccination is safe and effective in children with oncohematological malignancies.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of influenza vaccine in children with cancer.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	Both oddly want to talk about children whereas the reference seems explicitly to address adults
CD001261	The licensed Ty21a and Vi polysaccharide vaccines are efficacious. The new and unlicensed Vi-rEPA vaccine is as efficacious and may confer longer immunity.	SPNXTA	The current evidence base does not support the use of oral Vi vaccines for typhoid fever. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of this vaccine.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of the Ty21a vaccine in preventing typhoid fever.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD008361	We could not find convincing evidence that NBI is significantly better than high definition WLC for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas. We found evidence that NBI might be better than standard definition WLC and equal to high definition WLC for detection the patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas.	SPNXTA	The use of NBI compared with white light did not significantly improve the neoplasm detection rate. However, NBI was associated with an increased risk of non-polypoid adenoma, which may have an important role in the screening of colorectal neoplasias.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of NBI for colonoscopy.	B	Both wrong but A seems to make up a risk associated with NBI, and this is not supported in the reference (although i suppose *could* be in fact accurate)
CD004504	Harpagophytum Procumbens, Salix Alba and Capsicum Frutescens seem to reduce pain more than placebo. Additional trials testing these herbal medicines against standard treatments are needed. The quality of reporting in these trials was generally poor. Trialists should refer to the CONSORT statement extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions.	VNCH8M	Harpagophytum is an effective treatment for acute and chronic low-back pain. The evidence for its efficacy in chronic pain is less clear.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific extract of willow for the treatment of acute or chronic low-back pain.	A	
CD009109	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of conventional fillings over crowns for the restoration of root filled teeth. Until more evidence becomes available clinicians should continue to base decisions on how to restore root filled teeth on their own clinical experience, whilst taking into consideration the individual circumstances and preferences of their patients.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of fiber posts for endodontically treated premolars.	SPNXTA	There is currently insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether fibre-post restorations are superior to direct-placed compositeRestorations for endodontically treated premolars.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD004207	Treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with metalloporphyrins may reduce neonatal bilirubin levels and decrease the need for phototherapy and hospitalization. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that treatment with a metalloporphyrin decreases the risk of neonatal kernicterus or of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment due to bilirubin encephalopathy. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that cutaneous photosensitivity is increased with metalloporphyrin treatment. Routine treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a metalloporphyrin cannot be recommended at present.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any intervention for the treatment of hyperbilirubinaemia in term or near term infants.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of SnMP for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD003412	Overall there has been very little good quality research on treatments for BCC. Most trials have only evaluated BCCs in low risk locations. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments with surgery showing the lowest failure rates. Although cosmetic outcomes appear good with PDT, long-term follow-up data are needed. Other treatments might have some use but few have been compared to surgery. An ongoing study comparing imiquimod to surgery should clarify whether imiquimod is a useful option.	AQ85CE	Imiquimod 5% cream appears to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with Basal cell carcinoma. However, the evidence is based on a small number of patients and the quality of the evidence was poor. The quality of evidence for other topical treatments was poor, and the number of participants in the included trials was small. There is a need for more RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of topical imiquimid 5% in the management of Basal Cell carcinoma, and to compare it with other topical therapies.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that topical interferon is more effective than surgery for the treatment of superficial BCC. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of this cream over other treatments.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD001112	Caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly, for up to four hours, in people with asthma. People may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing, as caffeine ingestion could cause misinterpretation of the results. Drinking caffeinated coffee before taking exhaled nitric oxide measurements does not appear to affect the results of the test, but more studies are needed to confirm this.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of caffeine in the treatment of asthma. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of caffeine in the treatment of asthma.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of decaffeinated coffee for people with asthma.	B	They're both wrong, but A repeats itself
CD008871	Low-dose rate brachytherapy did not reduce biochemical recurrence-free survival versus radical prostatectomy at 5 years. For short-term severe adverse events, low-dose rate brachytherapy was significantly more favorable for urinary incontinence, but radical prostatectomy was significantly more favorable for urinary irritation. Evidence is based on one RCT with high risk of bias.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether radical retropubic prostatectomy is superior to brachytherapy for the treatment of low-risk CaP.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of radical retropubic prostatectomy for the treatment of low-risk CaP.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	Practically identical!
CD008012	Psychological interventions and pharmacological interventions with SSRIs may have a small yet clinically meaningful effect on depression outcomes in CAD patients. No beneficial effects on the reduction of mortality rates and cardiac events were found. Overall, however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of high quality trials per outcome and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of antidepressants in the treatment of depression in patients with MI.	VNCH8M	SSRIs are effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MI. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether SSRIs are effective in reducing mortality or morbidity in patients with MI.	B	Finally a spot on one!
CD008871	Low-dose rate brachytherapy did not reduce biochemical recurrence-free survival versus radical prostatectomy at 5 years. For short-term severe adverse events, low-dose rate brachytherapy was significantly more favorable for urinary incontinence, but radical prostatectomy was significantly more favorable for urinary irritation. Evidence is based on one RCT with high risk of bias.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of radical retropubic prostatectomy for the treatment of low-risk CaP.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether or not brachytherapy is superior to RRP in the treatment of low-risk prostate cancer.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD002855	Safe and effective medical abortion methods are available. Combined regimens are more effective than single agents. In the combined regimen, the dose of mifepristone can be lowered to 200 mg without significantly decreasing the method effectiveness. Vaginal misoprostol is more effective than oral administration, and has less side effects than sublingual or buccal. Some results are limited by the small numbers of participants on which they are based. Almost all trials were conducted in settings with good access to emergency services, which may limit the generalizability of these results.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of mifepristone in combination with vaginal misoprostol for women undergoing medical abortion.	SPNXTA	Vaginal misoprostol is an effective method of medical abortion in early pregnancy. It is less effective than mifepristone or mifecristone, or at the same dose, and is associated with higher rates of incomplete abortion. [Note: The six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the analysis once assessed.]	B	Going to give it to B because takeaway seems correct, although it has a weird parenthetical that is almost certainly not true
CD005137	In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either full or partial patching for the treatment of amblyopia. Further trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment for amblyopia.	SPNXTA	Optimal refractive correction improves amblyopic visual acuity compared with conventional patching. Optimal visual correction is not associated with improvement in amblyopia.	B	... I *think*?
CD007345	Prophylactic antibiotics reduce bacteriaemia and seem to prevent cholangitis and septicaemia in patients undergoing elective ERCP. In the subgroup of patients with uncomplicated ERCP, the effect of antibiotics may be less evident. Further research is required to determine whether antibiotics can be given during or after an ERCP if it becomes apparent that biliary obstruction cannot be relieved during that procedure.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis before ERCP.	PX7SGV	Theibiotic prophylaxis in patients with ERCP is associated with a reduction in bacteriologic failure. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of antibiotics in this population. Further research is needed.	B	
CD004998	The small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. Transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation. Drop out rates appear to be high, and adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of meditation for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of meditation for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD002786	The meta-analysis confirmed the beneficial effect of anti-platelet treatment as an adjuvant used to increase the patency of A-V fistulae and grafts in the short term.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antiplatelet agents for the prevention of thrombosis in patients undergoing access surgery. The is insufficient evidence to determine whether antiplatelet agents are beneficial or harmful. The is insufficient evidence to determine whether antiplatelet agents are beneficial or harmful.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antiplatelet agents in the prevention of thrombotic events in patients with ESRD.	B	Both wrong but A is... unreadable
CD001018	There is no evidence of an effect of unopposed oestrogen or combined oestrogen with progestogen on body weight and on the BMI increase normally experienced at the time of menopause. Insufficient evidence currently exists to enable examination of the effect of HRT on waist-hip ratio, fat mass or skinfold thickness.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of HRT for the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women.	SPNXTA	Hormone therapy in the postmenopausal period is effective in decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use in women with premenopausal symptoms.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	They both focus on the wrong outcomes apparently 
CD006866	Oral acyclovir did not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether other antiviral treatments prevent PHN. Additional well-designed, randomised controlled trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents, with a greater number of participants are needed. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.	PX7SGV	Thereral acyclovir appears to be effective in the treatment of acute herpes zoster. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support its use in clinical practice.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster.	B	B is more accurate but repeats itself
CD005542	There is little evidence to support the use of one particular form of insulin administration over another for pregnant women with diabetes. The data are few, there are only a small number of trials appropriate for meta-analysis, a small number of women included and questionable generalisability of the trial population. Conclusions cannot be made from the available data. Well-designed randomised trials are needed. These trials should be adequately powered to assess the effect of CSII versus MDI on important outcomes for women with diabetes and their infants.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of rapid insulin infusion therapy for women with pre-existing diabetes to improve pregnancy outcomes. Further research is needed to assess the effects of rapid infusion therapy on preterm birth, and to assess its role in the management of pre-eclampsia.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ICT in the management of women with type 1 diabetes.	A	B misses the pregnancy part
CD006332	Insufficient evidence exists for the safety or efficacy of naloxone or nalbuphine in the treatment of OBD. Long-term efficacy and safety of any of the opioid antagonists is unknown, as is the incidence or nature of rare adverse events. Alvimopan and methylnaltrexone both show promise in treating OBD, but further data will be required to fully assess their place in therapy.	AQ85CE	Alvimopan appears to be an effective treatment for opioid-induced constipation. However, the evidence is based on a small number of patients with a variety of different diagnoses and outcomes. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of alvimopAN for the treatment of opioid-related constipation and to assess its safety.	SPNXTA	Methylnaltrexone and diphenhydramine are effective in reversing gastrointestinal effects of opioids in patients with chronic constipation. Adverse events are frequent and severe.	A	B claims (without justification?) frequent and sever side effects
CD005331	Randomised studies are possible in this field. The use of psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder requires more research and it is not possible to draw any conclusions about their potential benefits or harms from the included studies.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of hypnosis for the treatment of motor conversion disorder. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of hypnosis for the treatment of motor conversion disorder. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of hypnosis for the treatment of motor conversion disorder.	AQ85CE	The limited evidence available suggests that paradoxical therapy may be effective in treating conversion disorder. However, the quality of the evidence is poor. The trials were small, of poor methodological quality and had a high risk of bias. The results should be interpreted with caution as they were based on a small number of studies with few participants and were heterogeneous. Further research is needed to determine the optimal type and duration of treatment, the optimal duration of therapy, the best way to deliver the therapy and to assess the effects of different types of paradoxical interventions.	B	B maybe goes out on a limb a little bit but seems largely accurate, A repeats itself
CD001066	Rutosides appear to help relieve the symptoms of varicose veins in late pregnancy. However, this finding is based on one small study (69 women) and there are not enough data presented in the study to assess its safety in pregnancy. It therefore cannot be routinely recommended. Reflexology appears to help improve symptoms for women with leg oedema, but again this is based on one small study (43 women). External compression stockings do not appear to have any advantages in reducing oedema.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether posturing or rest is more effective than rest in the treatment of women with pedal edema.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that rest, with or without medication, may be beneficial for pregnant women with leg oedema. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support the use of rest alone or in combination with other therapies.	B	
CD005542	There is little evidence to support the use of one particular form of insulin administration over another for pregnant women with diabetes. The data are few, there are only a small number of trials appropriate for meta-analysis, a small number of women included and questionable generalisability of the trial population. Conclusions cannot be made from the available data. Well-designed randomised trials are needed. These trials should be adequately powered to assess the effect of CSII versus MDI on important outcomes for women with diabetes and their infants.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether subcutaneous insulin therapy is superior to intensive insulin therapy in the management of maternal diabetes mellitus in pregnancy.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of rapid insulin infusion therapy for women with pre-existing diabetes to improve pregnancy outcomes. Further research is needed to assess the effects of rapid infusion therapy on preterm birth, and to assess its role in the management of pre-eclampsia.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	
CD000220	Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes. The cure rate could probably be higher if more partners used the treatment.	AQ85CE	Antibiotic treatment with metronidazole is effective in reducing the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth among women infected with trichomoniasis. The risk of neonatal death is higher with metonidazol. The optimal dose and duration of treatment remains unclear.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of metronidazole to prevent preterm birth in women with Trichomonas vaginalis infection.	Neither is more accurate (use sparingly)	I would have said A but the 2nd sentence asserting that risk of death is higher seems wrong I think? 
CD002265	This systematic review found one randomised controlled trial with a small number of patients in the different clinical subgroups of neurological manifestation. There is very low-quality evidence that cyclophosphamide is more effective in reducing symptoms of neuropsychiatric involvement in SLE compared with methylprednisolone. However, properly designed randomised controlled trials that involve large numbers of individuals, with explicit clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria, sufficient duration of follow-up and description of all relevant outcome measures, are necessary to guide practice. As we did not find any new trials to include in this review at update, the conclusions of the review did not change.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether cyclophosphamide is more effective than MP in the treatment of NPSLE.	JB6Z8F	Cyclophosphamide is more effective than MP in the treatment of acute, severe NPSLE.	B	
CD003794	Compared with placebo, combination therapy led to a significant reduction of a quarter in exacerbation rates. There was a significant reduction in all-cause mortality with the addition of data from the TORCH trial. The increased risk of pneumonia is a concern, and better reporting of this outcome in future studies would be helpful. In order to draw firmer conclusions about the effects of combination therapy in a single inhaler more data are necessary, particularly in relation to the profile of adverse events and benefits in relation to different doses of inhaled corticosteroids.	SPNXTA	In the short-term, inhaled corticosteroids given in combination with salmeterol significantly improved FEV1 compared with placebo, and significantly reduced the number of exacerbations per year. However, there was a significant increase in oral candidiasis.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD.	A	Kind of giving the benefit of the doubt here
CD003122	There is good evidence that both ERT and HRT do not prevent cognitive decline in older postmenopausal women when given as short term or longer term (up to five years) therapy. It is not known whether either specific types of ERT or HRT have specific effects in subgroups of women, although there was evidence that combined hormone therapy in similarly aged women was associated with a decrement in a number of verbal memory tests and a small improvement in a test of figural memory. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether subgroups of women using specific types of hormone therapy could benefit from treatment. It remains to be determined whether factors such as younger age (< 60 years of age), type of menopause (surgical or natural) and type of treatment (type of estrogen with or without a progestagen), mode of delivery (transdermal, oral or intramuscular) and dosage have positive effects at a clinically relevant level. In addition, whether the absence or presence of menopausal symptoms can modify treatment effects should be investigated in more detail. Large RCTs currently underway in the USA may be able to provide answers to these uncertainties by the year 2010. In the meantime, based on the available evidence, ERT or HRT cannot be recommended for overall cognitive improvement or maintenance in older postmenopausal women without cognitive impairment.	VNCH8M	EHR has no statistically significant effect on cognitive function in postmenopausal women.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of estrogen therapy in the treatment of women with dementia.	A	
CD005522	Tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol decreases pain intensity, produces symptom relief and improves function, but these benefits are small. Adverse events, although reversible and not life threatening, often cause participants to stop taking the medication and could limit tramadol or tramadol plus paracetamol usefulness.	AQ85CE	Tramadol is an effective analgesic for moderate to severe OA, providing pain relief at least equivalent to commonly used NSAIDs, with a lower incidence of adverse events. The addition of tramadol to commonly prescribed NSAIDs provides pain relief equivalent to about half of those treated with placebo, and comparable to about one-third of those given with placebo.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tramadol as an add-on treatment for OA.	A	Giving it to A even though it may be overstating efficacy
CD002047	Leflunomide appears to improve all clinical outcomes and delay radiologic progression at both six and 12 months of treatment compared to placebo. Its efficacy and adverse events are comparable to MTX, SSZ, and cyclosporin A up to two years of treatment. Combined leflunomide and MTX was more efficacious than MTX alone up to three years of treatment and the adverse events did not increase. Different dosages of leflunomide were similar regarding their effectiveness and toxicity.	SPNXTA	Leflunomide is an efficacious treatment for RA, but it is associated with a higher incidence of adverse events.	AQ85CE	The evidence from randomised controlled trials is insufficient to determine whether leflunomide treatment is effective in preventing the progression of chronic hand and foot cancer.	A	A is wrong about adverse events (explicitly contradicting reference), but gets the main effect right at least (whereas B does not)
CD005522	Tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol decreases pain intensity, produces symptom relief and improves function, but these benefits are small. Adverse events, although reversible and not life threatening, often cause participants to stop taking the medication and could limit tramadol or tramadol plus paracetamol usefulness.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tramadol for the treatment of chronic pain in patients with osteoarthritis. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of tramadol for the treatment of chronic pain in patients with osteoarthritis.	VNCH8M	Tramadol is an effective analgesic for moderate to severe OA. Its adverse effects are similar to those of other NSAIDs.	B	
CD005522	Tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol decreases pain intensity, produces symptom relief and improves function, but these benefits are small. Adverse events, although reversible and not life threatening, often cause participants to stop taking the medication and could limit tramadol or tramadol plus paracetamol usefulness.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of tramadol in the treatment of osteoarthritis.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tramadol for the treatment of chronic pain in patients with osteoarthritis.

CD004950	If available, breastfeeding or breast milk should be used to alleviate procedural pain in neonates undergoing a single painful procedure rather than placebo, positioning or no intervention. Administration of glucose/sucrose had similar effectiveness as breastfeeding for reducing pain. The effectiveness of breast milk for painful procedure should be studied in the preterm population, as there are currently a limited number of studies in the literature that have assessed it's effectiveness in this population.	SPNXTA	Breastfeeding may be effective in reducing pain in term newborns undergoing venipuncture. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of breastfeeding over other methods of pain relief.

CD007289	P-Chem may reduce the risk of progression to GTN in women with CMs who are at a high risk of malignant transformation; however, current evidence in favour of P-Chem is limited by the poor methodological quality and small size of the included studies. As P-Chem may increase drug resistance, delay treatment of GTN and expose women unnecessarily to toxic side effects, this practice cannot currently be recommended.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chemotherapy for patients with complete hydatidiform mole.	PX7SGV	Therephylactic chemotherapy reduces the incidence of secondary trophoblastic disease in high-risk patients with complete hydatidiform mole.	B	I'll give it to B because it agrees that there (may be) an effective, though not sure the intervention is quite right here! 
CD007771	The evidence base for the use of vitamin D for chronic pain in adults is poor at present. This is due to low quality and insufficient randomised controlled trials in this area of research.

Its adverse effects are mild and probably not life threatening.	A	
CD004943	The quality of the evidence was poor, but the findings suggest that the combination of antacids plus H2 antagonists was more effective than no intervention, and superior to antacids alone in preventing low gastric pH. However, none of the studies assessed potential adverse effects or substantive clinical outcomes. These findings are relevant for all women undergoing caesarean section under general anaesthesia.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any antisecretory agent to prevent aspiration of gastric contents during elective caesarean section. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of antisecretory agents to prevent aspiration of gastric contents during elective caesarean section.

CD003051	Surgical sealants reduce postoperative air leaks and time to chest drain removal but this reduction is not always associated with a reduction in length of postoperative hospital stay. Therefore, systematic use of surgical sealants with the objective of reducing hospital stay cannot be recommended at the moment. More and larger randomized controlled clinical trials are needed.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of fibrin glue for the prevention of air leaks after lung resections. The evidence is limited, however, and the evidence is not strong enough to support its routine use.

CD001036	Extended tip spatulas of various designs appear to be better for collecting endocervical cells than the commonly used Ayre spatula. The most effective combination appears to be the cytobrush with an extended tip spatula. The rate of detection of endocervical cells appears to be a valid and convenient surrogate for the ability to detect dyskaryosis and for adequate smear rates. The ability of the extended tip spatula with the cytobrush compared with the extended tip spatula alone to detect disease, needs to be evaluated in a trial.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any one method of cervical cytology for the screening of women.

CD006170	The most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. Low cost interventions including early initiation when not feeding at the breast, relaxation, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. Small sample sizes, large standard deviations, small number of studies reviewed, and the diversity of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the specific settings.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of breast pumps for women who wish to continue breastfeeding their infants. Further research is needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any particular pump type or method for breast milk production in preterm infants.

CD003654	Diuretics are preferred first-line over CCBs to optimize reduction of cardiovascular events. The review does not distinguish between CCBs, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, but does provide evidence supporting the use of CCBs over β-blockers. Many of the differences found in the current review are not robust and further trials might change the conclusions. More well-designed RCTs studying the mortality and morbidity of patients taking CCBs as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension, different ages, and with different co-morbidities such as diabetes.

CD004115	Rectal 5-ASA should be considered a first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderately active distal UC. The optimal total daily dose and dose frequency of 5-ASA remain to be determined. Future research should define differences in efficacy among patient subgroups defined by proximal disease margin and disease activity. There is a strong need for consensus standardization of outcome measurements for clinical trials in ulcerative colitis.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of 5-ASA enemas for the treatment of patients with active distal ulcerative colitis.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the included trials was limited. The small number of patients and the small sample sizes of the included studies limit the generalisability of the findings. The results suggest that pentasa is an effective treatment for mild to moderate proctosigmoiditis.		
CD007191	Based on limited data, azithromycin or clarithromycin appeared to be a prophylactic agent of choice for MAC infection. Further studies are needed, especially direct comparison of clarithromycin and azithromycin. In additions, studies that will compare different doses and regimens are needed.	VNCH8M	Azithromycin is effective in preventing M. avium complex disease in patients with AIDS.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of antiviral prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients with increased CD4+ cell counts to reduce the risk of M. avium complex infection.		
CD005959	The available evidence shows that intramedullary nailing is associated with an increased risk of shoulder impingement, with a related increase in restriction of shoulder movement and need for removal of metalwork. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there were any other important differences, including in functional outcome, between dynamic compression plating and locked intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fractures.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of intramedullary nails for the treatment of acute humeral shaft fractures.

Overall, however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of high quality trials per outcome and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence of a benefit of IPT over usual care in patients with major depression or CKD. There is evidence that IPT is associated with a reduction in depression and hostility. There are no studies of psychosocial interventions in patients who have had an acute MI and CKD and there are no RCTs of psychotherapy interventions in these patients.

PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of antidepressants in the treatment of depression in patients with MI.		
CD005413	We failed to find any clear evidence that the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy increases survival of people with metastatic melanoma. Further use of combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy should only be done in the context of clinical trials.	JB6Z8F	The combination of dacarbazine and interferon-alpha-2b appears to be superior to dacarbazine alone in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. However, the use of interferon-alpha-2b in combination with dacarbazine is associated with increased toxicity.	SPNXTA	The addition of interferon to chemotherapy does not improve overall survival or time to progression in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.		
CD004277	There is limited evidence that cyclosporine is more effective than standard treatment alone for severe ulcerative colitis. The relatively quick response makes the short-term use of cyclosporine potentially attractive, but the long-term benefit is unclear, when adverse events such as cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity may become more obvious. There is a need for additional research on quality of life, costs and long-term results from cyclosporine therapy in severe ulcerative colitis.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that cyclosporine is an effective treatment for patients with ulcerative colitis.

However, there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an alternative to glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of acute UC.		
CD003159	The clinical studies on nicergoline were carried out with diverse criteria and modalities of evaluation. Despite this, the 14 studies included in this review, have presented generally consistent results. Results of this meta-analysis provide some evidence of positive effects of nicergoline on cognition and behaviour and these effects are supported by an effect on clinical global impression. There was some evidence that there were increased risk of adverse effects associated with nicergoline. These results were obtained on older patients with mild to moderate cognitive and behavioural impairment of various clinical origins, including chronic cerebrovascular disorders and Alzheimer's dementia. The few studies specifically performed on patients with Alzheimer's disease were performed with too few people to give a definitive answer to the questions concerning the use of nicergoline for this form of dementia.This drug has not been evaluated using current diagnostic categories such as MCI or in association with therapeutic agents of different nature such as cholinesterase or antioxidant drugs.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ergogoline in the treatment of dementia.

CD001342	For the secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke after TIA or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that vitamin K antagonists in any dose are not more efficacious than antiplatelet therapy and that medium and high intensity anticoagulation leads to a significant increase in major bleeding complications.	AQ85CE	Oral anticoagulants are effective in preventing vascular events in patients with transient ischaemic stroke and minor ischaemia. However, the evidence is limited. The effect of oral anticoagenics on mortality and major vascular events is unknown.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke in patients with TIA.		
CD001055	Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy reduce the proportion of women who continue to smoke in late pregnancy, and reduce low birthweight and preterm birth. Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy need to be implemented in all maternity care settings. Given the difficulty many pregnant women addicted to tobacco have quitting during pregnancy, population-based measures to reduce smoking and social inequalities should be supported.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that there is no evidence to support the use of antenatal smoking cessation interventions to improve smoking cessation rates among pregnant women. There is a need for further research to determine whether antenatal interventions are effective and cost-effective.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antenatal smoking cessation interventions to reduce smoking during pregnancy.		
CD006616	Overall, this meta-analysis puts doubt on the safety and utility of intravenous N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy in SIRS and sepsis. At best, N-acetylcysteine is ineffective in reducing mortality and complications in this patient population. At worst, it can be harmful, especially when administered later than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, by causing cardiovascular depression. Unless future RCTs provide evidence of treatment effect, clinicians should not routinely use intravenous N-acetylcysteine in SIRS or sepsis and academics should not promote its use.	VNCH8M	N-acetylcysteine may reduce the risk of acute renal failure and mortality in patients with moderate to severe acute sepsis. However, the evidence is limited and the results should be interpreted with caution.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence that antioxidant therapy in patients with acute lung injury reduces mortality or morbidity, but there is evidence that it may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.		
CD005203	There may be some benefit in using an egg-free diet in infants with suspected egg allergy who have positive specific IgE to eggs. Little evidence supports the use of various exclusion diets in unselected people with atopic eczema, but that may be because they were not allergic to those substances in the first place. Lack of any benefit may also be because the studies were too small and poorly reported. Future studies should be appropriately powered focusing on participants with a proven food allergy. In addition a distinction should be made between young children whose food allergies improve with time and older children/adults.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific diet for the management of eczema in infants. Further research is required to determine the optimal diet for the management of eczema in infants.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of exclusion diets in the management of atopic eczema. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of exclusion diets in the management of atopic eczema.		
CD000345	Pretreatment with glucocorticosteroids before treatment with alfa interferon in patients with hepatitis B 'e' antigen positive chronic hepatitis B may be more effective than treatment with alfa interferon alone with regard to loss of hepatitis B 'e' antigen and hepatitis B virus DNA, but evidence for effect on clinical outcomes is lacking.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis.	VNCH8M	Interferon is an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B. However, the evidence is limited. There is no evidence of benefit from interferon alone or with or without steroid pretreatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B.		
CD005137	In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either full or partial patching for the treatment of amblyopia. Further trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment for amblyopia.	8FWF5T	pharmacologic interventions for amblyopia are effective in improving visual acuity and improving contrast sensitivity. The is no evidence that patching is more effective than placebo or glasses in treating severe amblyopia. The is no evidence that patching is more effective than placebo or glasses in treating mild amblyopia.		
CD003654	Diuretics are preferred first-line over CCBs to optimize reduction of cardiovascular events.

More well-designed RCTs studying the mortality and morbidity of patients taking CCBs as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension, different ages, and with different co-morbidities such as diabetes.	VNCH8M	ACE inhibitors are effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of ACE inhibitors over other first-line treatments for hypertension.	SPNXTA	Corticosteroids and calcium channel blockers reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in hypertensive patients. However, there is no evidence to support the use of calcium antagonists in patients with mild hypertension.		
CD008361	We could not find convincing evidence that NBI is significantly better than high definition WLC for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas. We found evidence that NBI might be better than standard definition WLC and equal to high definition WLC for detection the patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas.	AQ85CE	There is evidence that NBI improves the detection of colorectal adenomatous polyps in colorespiratory endoscopy. The evidence is weak and inconclusive. The results of this review suggest that NII may be associated with a small reduction in the risk of colorem adenoma.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of NBI in the screening of colorectal cancer. There is a need for well-designed, adequately powered randomised controlled trials.		
CD000220	Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes. The cure rate could probably be higher if more partners used the treatment.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of metronidazole for trichomoniasis in pregnant women.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of metronidazole for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis in preterm women. The results of this review suggest that metronidazole may be beneficial for the prevention of vaginal candidiasis in preterm women.		
CD007672	Results from this Cochrane review do not allow us to conclude on the effectiveness of included interventions to improve continuity of care on patient, healthcare provider or process of care outcomes. Future research should evaluate interventions that target an improvement in continuity as their primary objective and describe these interventions with the categories proposed in this review. Also of importance, continuity measures should be validated with persons with cancer who have been followed in various settings.	AQ85CE	Home-based psychosocial interventions for cancer patients with incurable disease may have a positive effect on quality of life and may reduce pain, but the evidence is weak and inconclusive. There is a need for more studies with larger sample sizes and better reporting of outcomes.	SPNXTA	Nurse-led care interventions are effective in improving the quality of life for cancer patients and their carers, and in reducing the number of patients who are unable to be referred to specialist care. Nurse-led outcomes in cancer patients are associated with increased satisfaction with pain management, and improved health-related quality-of-life outcomes.		
CD007293	This review has shown that routine pre-operative testing does not increase the safety of cataract surgery. Alternatives to routine preoperative medical testing have been proposed, including self-administered health questionnaires, which could substitute for health provider histories and physical examinations. Such avenues may lead to cost-effective means of identifying those at increased risk of medical adverse events due to cataract surgery. However, despite the rare occurrence, adverse medical events precipitated by cataract surgery remain a concern because of the large number of elderly patients with multiple medical comorbidities who have cataract surgery in various settings. The studies summarized in this review should assist recommendations for the standard of care of cataract surgery, at least in developed settings. Unfortunately, in developing country settings, medical history questionnaires would be useless to screen for risk since few people have ever been to a physician, let alone been diagnosed with any chronic disease.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support routine screening of patients for cataract surgery. The is insufficient evidence to support routine screening of patients for cataract surgery.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support routine preoperative medical testing for cataract surgery.		
CD006866	Oral acyclovir did not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether other antiviral treatments prevent PHN. Additional well-designed, randomised controlled trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents, with a greater number of participants are needed. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.	VNCH8M	Acyclovir is an effective treatment for herpes zoster. However, the evidence is limited. There is no evidence of benefit for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.	PX7SGV	Thereral acyclovir appears to be effective in the treatment of acute herpes zoster. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support its use in clinical practice.		
CD002231	Based on one low quality trial, the medicinal herb 'Jianpi Wenshen recipe' may have an antiviral activity in asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B virus. However, rigorous randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed before herbs should be used for this condition.	JB6Z8F	Phyllanthus amarus is effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus carriers.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the included trials was limited. There was no evidence of benefit from any of the herbal medicines reviewed. There is a need for further well-designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of phyllanthus amarus for hepatitis B.		
CD002992	Cardioselective beta-blockers given in mild to moderate reversible airway disease or COPD do not produce adverse respiratory effects. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, these agents should not be withheld from such patients. Long-term safety still needs to be established.	SPNXTA	Cardioselective beta-blockers have a small effect on FEV1 and are associated with a small reduction in heart rate and fall of blood pressure in hypertensive asthmatics. However, the small effect of one cardioseslective drug (100 mg/day) versus placebo in a randomised controlled trial on heart rate, fall of BP and lung function is inconclusive. The effect of a cardiOSElectivebeta-blocker on pulmonary function is small and probably not clinically important.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of beta-2 agonists in patients with asthma.		
CD007166	Compared to placebo, adjuvant therapy reduces off-time, levodopa dose, and improves UPDRS scores in PD patients who develop motor complications on levodopa therapy. However, this is at the expense of increased dyskinesia and numerous other side-effects. Indirect comparisons suggest that dopamine agonist therapy may be more effective than COMTI and MAOBI therapy, which have comparable efficacy. However, as indirect comparisons should be interpreted with caution, direct head-to-head randomised trials assessing the impact of these different drug classes on overall patient-rated quality of life are needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the drugs included in this review for the treatment of PD.	VNCH8M	Entacapone, tolcapone, and entacapone reduce levodopa dose in patients with Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations. Pramipexole and pramipexole may reduce levodopa dose in patients with Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations. Pramipexole may reduce levodopa dose in patients with Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations.		
CD007224	Our systematic review did not demonstrate any significant benefit of off-pump compared with on-pump CABG regarding mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction. In contrast, we observed better long-term survival in the group of patients undergoing on-pump CABG with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. Based on the current evidence, on-pump CABG should continue to be the standard surgical treatment. However, off-pump CABG may be acceptable when there are contraindications for cannulation of the aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass. Further randomised clinical trials should address the optimal treatment in such patients.	SPNXTA	CPB is associated with significantly reduced mortality and cardiovascular-related morbidity when compared to other surgical procedures. However, the clinical significance of this reduction is uncertain due to the heterogeneity of the studies and the high risk of bias in the included studies. Further research is required to determine the optimal surgical technique, the optimal timing and duration of CPB, and the optimal off-pump technique.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether CPB is superior to conventional revascularization in terms of clinical outcomes.		
CD007404	We did not find RCTs evaluating the effects of primary surgical versus primary non-surgical interventions for central giant cell granuloma of the jaws. Although a number of non-surgical therapies have been proposed for treating central giant cell granuloma of the jaws, our review did not identify evidence from RCTs to support their use. More research is needed on this topic.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of calcitonin for the treatment of patients with granuloma of the jaw.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of calcitonin for the treatment of CGG.		
CD004998	The small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. Transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation. Drop out rates appear to be high, and adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of meditation for the treatment of anxiety disorders.

CD000143	Implications for practice: nasal CPAP is effective in preventing failure of extubation in preterm infants following a period of endotracheal intubation and IPPV. Implication for research: further definition of the gestational age and weight groups in whom these results apply is warranted. Optimal levels of NCPAP as well as methods of administration remain to be determined.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CPAP in preterm infants to facilitate the removal of mechanical ventilation. Further research is needed to determine the optimal CPAP strategy.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of NCPAP for elective extubation of preterm infants.		
CD002869	The effects of general antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood, or both, remain largely unknown. Individualized prenatal education directed toward avoidance of a repeat caesarean birth does not increase the rate of vaginal birth after caesarean section. [Note: the 58 citations in the awaiting classification section may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that antenatal education and support programs are beneficial for the mother and baby during pregnancy and postpartum. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the introduction of such programs to all women. Further research is needed to assess the effects of antenatal training on maternal attachment and maternal well-being.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antenatal education to promote vaginal birth after cesarean section.		
CD002964	Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence to suggest that culturally sensitive videotape may be beneficial for improving parent-infant interaction. However, the evidence is too limited to draw any conclusions. Further research is needed to assess the effects of culturally insensitive videotape on infant and social functioning.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of videotape as a means of improving parenting skills among young people.		
CD006790	The existing literature does not support the efficacy of type I IFNs for induction of remission in patients with UC. Given concerns regarding the tolerability of IFN therapy, we suggest that the results of two ongoing trials are evaluated for efficacy and safety prior to development or commencement of further randomised controlled trials of type I IFNs in UC.	SPNXTA	Interferon-beta-1a appears to be effective in the induction of remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis. However, the small number of patients studied and the high risk of bias in the included studies limit the validity of the findings. Further research is required to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment, and the optimal route of administration.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon-beta-1a for the treatment of patients with active ulcerative colitis. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of interferon-beta-1a for the treatment of patients with active ulcerative colitis.		
CD010611	Valproate is effective in reducing headache frequency and is reasonably well tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that ELS is effective in reducing pain intensity and frequency of attacks in patients with migraine headaches. However, the number of patients studied is small and the number included in the analysis is heterogeneous. The number of participants studied is too small to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of ELS compared with placebo.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproate as a prophylactic agent for migraine.		
CD004207	Treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with metalloporphyrins may reduce neonatal bilirubin levels and decrease the need for phototherapy and hospitalization. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that treatment with a metalloporphyrin decreases the risk of neonatal kernicterus or of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment due to bilirubin encephalopathy. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that cutaneous photosensitivity is increased with metalloporphyrin treatment. Routine treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a metalloporphyrin cannot be recommended at present.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any intervention for the treatment of hyperbilirubinaemia in term or near term infants.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of mesorphyrin for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants. The results of this review suggest that mesorphyrin may be beneficial for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants. The research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of mesorphyrin therapy.		
CD004791	The pooled estimates suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis might be prudent among cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding. However, poor trial methodology and report coupled with findings suggesting systematic bias in publication and design reflect the fragility of these findings. Potential hazard to society and the patients themselves from resistant pathogens should be considered when promoting long-lasting antibiotic prophylaxis. It seems that recommending antibiotic prophylaxis is still far from being a substantiated prevention strategy. Trials of better design, well reported, and of longer follow-up are greatly needed.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether antibiotics are effective in preventing recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of norfloxacin for the prevention of bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.		
CD004571	There is no evidence to show a significant beneficial effect of calcium antagonists on muscle function in DMD.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of calcium channel blockers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of patients with nuchenne muscular dystrophy. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of patients with nuchenne muscular dystrophy.		
CD007771	The evidence base for the use of vitamin D for chronic pain in adults is poor at present. This is due to low quality and insufficient randomised controlled trials in this area of research.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin D for the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium-containing drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The is a need for well-designed, well-powered, randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of calcium-containing drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.		
CD008871	Low-dose rate brachytherapy did not reduce biochemical recurrence-free survival versus radical prostatectomy at 5 years. For short-term severe adverse events, low-dose rate brachytherapy was significantly more favorable for urinary incontinence, but radical prostatectomy was significantly more favorable for urinary irritation. Evidence is based on one RCT with high risk of bias.	AQ85CE	There is no evidence to support the use of brachytherapy for low-risk prostate cancer.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of brachytherapy for patients with low-risk prostatic cancer.		
CD002231	Based on one low quality trial, the medicinal herb 'Jianpi Wenshen recipe' may have an antiviral activity in asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B virus. However, rigorous randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed before herbs should be used for this condition.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of marumarusanthus in the treatment of chronic hepatitis. The results of the studies reviewed are based on a small number of patients and the results are not consistent. The results of the studies reviewed do not support the use of marumarusanthus in the treatment of chronic hepatitis.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of Phyllanthus amarus for the eradication of hepatitis B virus.		
CD005568	Due to the generally low methodological quality and small sample size of the included trials in this systematic review, we could not draw a firm conclusion.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of Erigeron injection in the treatment of patients with acute cerebral infarction.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of Erigeron in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.		
CD006963	There is insufficient evidence from the two included trials, to conclude that one procedure is better or worse than another. The included trials compared different interventions and were at high risk of bias and therefore no implications for practice can be given. Further high quality randomized controlled trials with long term follow-up are required.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vertical ramus osteotomy for prognathic mandibles. The use of intraoral vertical ramosotomy is associated with a significant reduction in pain and a significantly shorter recovery time compared with conventional surgery.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of vertical ramus osteotomy for the treatment of mandibular prognathism.		
CD004878	Current evidence does not support a clinically relevant effect of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids on admissions or length of hospitalisation. Combined dexamethasone and epinephrine may reduce outpatient admissions, but results are exploratory and safety data limited. Future research should further assess the efficacy, harms and applicability of combined therapy.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of children with bronchiolitis. The use of corticosteroids in children with bronchiolitis is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission. The use of corticosteroids in children with bronchiolitis is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission.	VNCH8M	Corticosteroids are effective in the short-term in reducing hospital admission and duration of oxygen therapy in children with acute bronchiolitis. However, the long-term effects of corticosteroids on mortality and hospital stay are not known.		
CD003427	Prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous sickle cell disease, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of penicillin in children with sickle cell disease. The is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of pneumococcal vaccines in children with sickle cell disease.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the two included trials is insufficient to determine whether the use of pneumococcal vaccine in children with sickle cell disease prevents the development of serotype-specific IgG antibodies. The use of vaccine in this population is associated with a reduction in the risk of severe adverse events.		
CD004957	Based on the heterogeneity and the low quality of the included trials that precluded pooled meta-analysis, there is silver level evidence that following hip or knee joint replacement, early multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve outcomes at the level of activity and participation. The optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. Future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis.	AQ85CE	There is evidence that the provision of a clinical pathway to patients following hip and knee arthroplasty reduces the length of stay in hospital and the length and duration of hospital stay in the short term. There is no evidence that this benefit is associated with an increase in the rate of complications or readmissions.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of clinical pathways for patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty.		
CD003412	Overall there has been very little good quality research on treatments for BCC. Most trials have only evaluated BCCs in low risk locations. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments with surgery showing the lowest failure rates. Although cosmetic outcomes appear good with PDT, long-term follow-up data are needed. Other treatments might have some use but few have been compared to surgery. An ongoing study comparing imiquimod to surgery should clarify whether imiquimod is a useful option.	VNCH8M	Interferon s are effective in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the small sample sizes. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of interferon s for the treatment of patients with BCC.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical or systemic agents for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.		
CD006122	The available evidence suggests that use of high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat enteral feeds in patients with at least 10% TBSA burns might reduce the incidence of pneumonia compared with use of a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet. The available evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect of either enteral feeding regimen on mortality. Note that the available evidence is limited to two small studies judged to be of moderate risk of bias. Further research is needed in this area before strong conclusions can be drawn.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of low-fat nutritional support in burn patients.	SPNXTA	There is currently insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of any particular dietary intervention for adults with severe burns.		
CD009192	We found only one eligible study. Although this study showed the use of the telephone for HIV test results notification was more effective than face-to-face delivery, it had a high-risk of bias. The study was conducted about 13 years ago in a high-income country, on a high-risk population, with low HIV prevalence, and the applicability of its results to other settings and contexts is unclear. The study did not provide information about telephone HIV test results notification of HIV positive people since none of the intervention group participants were HIV positive. We found no information about the acceptability of the intervention to patients’ and providers’, its economic outcomes or potential adverse effects. There is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of telephone use for HIV test results notification.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of telephone notification for HIV testing in youth.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of telephone notification for HIV testing of HIV positive youth.		
CD004611	There is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy for C. difficile colitis. There is no evidence to support the use of probiotics alone in the treatment of C. difficile colitis.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of antibiotics in patients with recurrent CDD.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics in the treatment of patients with recurrent or complicated clostridium difficile infection. The is a need for larger randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of patients with recurrent or complicated clostridium difficile infection.		
CD006943	The included studies do not provide sufficient detail about the harms and benefits of treating covert bacteriuria to enable formation of reliable conclusions. It appears that antibiotic treatment for covert bacteriuria is unlikely to benefit children in the long term.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence to support routine screening of schoolgirls for cobert bacteriuria of childhood.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence to support or refute the use of bacteriuria screening in children with pyelonephritis. The is no evidence to support or refute the use of bacteriuria screening in children with pyelonephritis.		
CD006432	There is insufficient good quality evidence to make recommendations about the relative effect of simultaneous bilateral training compared to placebo, no intervention or usual care. We identified evidence that suggests that bilateral training may be no more (or less) effective than usual care or other upper limb interventions for performance in ADL, functional movement of the upper limb or motor impairment outcomes.	AQ85CE	There is evidence that arm training is effective in improving function in people with moderate to severe arm weakness. There is no evidence that it improves function in those with low to moderate arm weakness, but the evidence is limited. There are no studies assessing the effectiveness of arm training in people who are at high risk of arm weakness or who are in the subacute phase of rehabilitation.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of unilateral or bilateral arm training in the rehabilitation of people with chronic stroke.		
CD009202	There is lack of robust and randomised controlled evidence that can clarify the efficacy of propofol and thiopental sodium over each other in the treatment of RSE. There is a need for large, randomised controlled trials for this serious condition.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of propofol for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of barbiturates in the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy. The is a need for well-designed, well-powered, and adequately powered randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of barbiturates in the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy.		
CD007289	P-Chem may reduce the risk of progression to GTN in women with CMs who are at a high risk of malignant transformation; however, current evidence in favour of P-Chem is limited by the poor methodological quality and small size of the included studies. As P-Chem may increase drug resistance, delay treatment of GTN and expose women unnecessarily to toxic side effects, this practice cannot currently be recommended.	PX7SGV	Therephylactic chemotherapy reduces the incidence of secondary trophoblastic disease in high-risk patients with complete hydatidiform mole.	SPNXTA	Prophylactic chemotherapy reduces the risk of persistent trophoblastic disease in high risk patients with complete hydatidiform mole.		
CD003893	Methyldopa lowers blood pressure to varying degrees compared to placebo for patients with primary hypertension. Its effect on clinical outcomes, however, remains uncertain.	SPNXTA	Methyldopa is effective in reducing blood pressure in moderate to high hypertensive patients with moderate to severe hypertension. However, it is not clear whether this effect is sustained beyond the treatment period.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of metoprolol for the treatment of intermittent claudication.		
CD008203	Available evidence showed that rosuvastatin was associated with a reduced incidence of VTE, but the evidence was limited to a single RCT. Randomised controlled trials of statins (including rosuvastatin) are needed to evaluate the efficacy of statins in the prevention of VTE.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of statin therapy for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with deep vein thrombosis.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of statin therapy for the prevention of VTE.		
CD006616	Overall, this meta-analysis puts doubt on the safety and utility of intravenous N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy in SIRS and sepsis. At best, N-acetylcysteine is ineffective in reducing mortality and complications in this patient population. At worst, it can be harmful, especially when administered later than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, by causing cardiovascular depression. Unless future RCTs provide evidence of treatment effect, clinicians should not routinely use intravenous N-acetylcysteine in SIRS or sepsis and academics should not promote its use.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence that antioxidant therapy in patients with acute lung injury reduces mortality or morbidity, but there is evidence that it may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of N-acetylcysteine in the treatment of patients with ALI/ARDS. Further research is needed.		
CD002068	There is evidence to support the effectiveness of bisphosphonates in providing some pain relief for bone metastases. There is insufficient evidence to recommend bisphosphonates for immediate effect; as first line therapy; to define the most effective bisphosphonates or their relative effectiveness for different primary neoplasms. Bisphosphonates should be considered where analgesics and/or radiotherapy are inadequate for the management of painful bone metastases.	VNCH8M	Bisphosphonates may be effective in reducing skeletal morbidity in patients with metastatic bone disease and pain. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of bisphosphonates for bone disease.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of bisphosphonates for the treatment of pain in patients with metastatic bone disease. The evidence is based on small trials and is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of bisphosphonates for the treatment of pain in patients with metastatic bone disease.		
CD001831	There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study characteristics and quality. Studies often showed conflicting results with uncertainty regarding clinical relevance. Higher quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of self care treatments for acute cough.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific cough suppressant for adults with the common cold. The choice of which cough suppressants to use should depend on the individual patient's preferences, preferences and preferences.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the currently available antitussives for the treatment of cough. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the currently available antitussives for the treatment of cough.		
CD005137	In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.	8FWF5T	pharmacologic interventions for amblyopia are effective in improving visual acuity and improving contrast sensitivity. The is no evidence that patching is more effective than placebo or glasses in treating severe amblyopia. The is no evidence that patching is more effective than placebo or glasses in treating mild amblyopia.	VNCH8M	Patching is effective in improving visual acuity in children aged 3 to 17 years. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend full-time patching for treating moderate to severe amblyopia.		
CD003794	Compared with placebo, combination therapy led to a significant reduction of a quarter in exacerbation rates. There was a significant reduction in all-cause mortality with the addition of data from the TORCH trial. The increased risk of pneumonia is a concern, and better reporting of this outcome in future studies would be helpful. In order to draw firmer conclusions about the effects of combination therapy in a single inhaler more data are necessary, particularly in relation to the profile of adverse events and benefits in relation to different doses of inhaled corticosteroids.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD.		
CD006170	The most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. Low cost interventions including early initiation when not feeding at the breast, relaxation, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. Small sample sizes, large standard deviations, small number of studies reviewed, and the diversity of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the specific settings.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether breast milk expressed by breast pumps is better or worse than breast milk obtained by manual expression. There is a need for further research to determine if breast milk derived by breast pump is better than breast pumps obtained by human expression.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence that electro-pumping may be more effective than manual expression for breastfeeding. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend electro-Pump over other pump types. Further research is needed to determine the optimal pump type, the optimal duration of pump use, and the optimal method of expressing breast milk.		
CD008288	Although there were significant glucose-lowering effects with the use of some herbal mixtures, due to methodological deficiencies and small sample sizes we are unable to draw any definite conclusions regarding their efficacy. Though no significant adverse events were reported, there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend the use of these interventions in routine clinical practice and further studies are needed.	SPNXTA	There is currently insufficient evidence from RCTs to support or refute the use of herbal medicines for type 2 diabetes mellitus.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of herbal medicines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.		
CD009190	We found only one RCT, with a moderate risk of bias, which showed that providing PEP support by phone calls did not result in higher adherence to PEP. However, the RCT was conducted in an upper-middle-income country with high HIV prevalence, on a high-risk population and the applicability of its results on other settings and contexts is unclear. There is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of using phone calls for providing PEP support and for other HIV prevention interventions.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychosocial interventions for improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy after sexual violence.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tablet-based interventions for the treatment of depressive illness. The is a need for well-designed, adequately powered, and adequately powered randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of tablet-based interventions for the treatment of depressive illness.		
CD003700	The evidence does not suggest a significant reduction in mortality, measures of morbidity, nor an effect on the clinical course of pneumonia with vitamin A adjunctive treatment in children with non-measles pneumonia. However, not all studies measured all outcomes, which limited the number of studies that could be incorporated into the meta-analyses, so that there may have been a lack of statistical power to detect statistically significant differences.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of vitamin A as an adjunct to standard treatment of pneumonia in children.	AQ85CE	VAS may be beneficial in children with pneumonia. However, the evidence is limited. The trials included in this review were of short duration and of poor quality. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment for children with acute pneumonia.

CD002964	Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of videotape as a means of improving parenting skills among adolescents.

Further research is needed to assess the effects of culturally insensitive videotape on infant and social functioning.		
CD006161	Current evidence suggests that supplementary oxygen given to healthy term pregnant women during elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia is associated with higher maternal and neonatal oxygen levels (maternal SpO2, PaO2, UaPO2 and UvPO2) and higher levels of oxygen free radicals. However, the intervention was neither beneficial nor harmful to the neonate's short-term clinical outcome as assessed by Apgar scores.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of supplemental oxygen during elective caesarean section.

VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of oxygen therapy for women undergoing caesarean section.		
CD003051	Surgical sealants reduce postoperative air leaks and time to chest drain removal but this reduction is not always associated with a reduction in length of postoperative hospital stay. Therefore, systematic use of surgical sealants with the objective of reducing hospital stay cannot be recommended at the moment. More and larger randomized controlled clinical trials are needed.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of fibrin glue for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis after pulmonary resections.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of any intervention to reduce the incidence of postoperative air leaks.		
CD001340	A policy of using ECMO in mature infants with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure results in significantly improved survival without increased risk of severe disability. The benefit of ECMO for babies with diaphragmatic hernia is unclear. Further studies are needed to consider the optimal timing for introducing ECMO; to identify which infants are most likely to benefit; and to address the implications of neonatal ECMO during later childhood and adult life.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of ECMO in the treatment of infants with severe pulmonary hypertension.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of ECMO in neonates with severe pulmonary hypertension.		
CD003264	One year of 28 IU/m²/wk rhGH in children with CKD resulted in a 3.88 cm increase in height velocity above that of untreated patients. Studies were too short to determine if continuing treatment resulted in an increase in final adult height.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence that growth hormone treatment improves growth in children with chronic renal failure. The is evidence that growth is improved in children with chronic renal failure treated with growth hormone. The is no evidence that growth is improved in children who are treated with growth hormone.

PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of recombinant human growth hormone in the treatment of children with renal failure.		
CD002855	Safe and effective medical abortion methods are available. Combined regimens are more effective than single agents. In the combined regimen, the dose of mifepristone can be lowered to 200 mg without significantly decreasing the method effectiveness. Vaginal misoprostol is more effective than oral administration, and has less side effects than sublingual or buccal. Some results are limited by the small numbers of participants on which they are based. Almost all trials were conducted in settings with good access to emergency services, which may limit the generalizability of these results.	AQ85CE	The use of mifepristone in combination with gemeprost is effective in inducing immediate and selective abortion. Gemeprost may be less effective than mifenecristone.	SPNXTA	Vaginal misoprostol is an effective method of medical abortion in early pregnancy. It is less effective than mifepristone or mifecristone, or at the same dose, and is associated with higher rates of incomplete abortion. [Note: The six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the analysis once assessed.]		
CD004943	The quality of the evidence was poor, but the findings suggest that the combination of antacids plus H2 antagonists was more effective than no intervention, and superior to antacids alone in preventing low gastric pH. However, none of the studies assessed potential adverse effects or substantive clinical outcomes. These findings are relevant for all women undergoing caesarean section under general anaesthesia.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral antisecretory agents for caesarean section in women undergoing anaesthesia.	VNCH8M	Cimetidine is effective in reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonitis in women undergoing elective caesarean section. Adverse events were not reported.		
CD004277	There is limited evidence that cyclosporine is more effective than standard treatment alone for severe ulcerative colitis. The relatively quick response makes the short-term use of cyclosporine potentially attractive, but the long-term benefit is unclear, when adverse events such as cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity may become more obvious. There is a need for additional research on quality of life, costs and long-term results from cyclosporine therapy in severe ulcerative colitis.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cyclosporine as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with severe ulcerative colitis.	PX7SGV	Thereclosporine appears to be an effective treatment for patients with severe UC. However, there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an alternative to glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of acute UC.		
CD003713	There is no evidence that pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm is superior to rate control. Rhythm control is associated with more adverse effects and increased hospitalisation. It does not reduce the risk of stroke. The conclusions cannot be generalised to all people with atrial fibrillation. Most of the patients included in these studies were relatively older (>60 years) with significant cardiovascular risk factors.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of either rate control or rhythm control in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.	SPNXTA	The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether rate control is superior to rate control in the management of atrial fibrillation.		
CD002068	There is evidence to support the effectiveness of bisphosphonates in providing some pain relief for bone metastases. There is insufficient evidence to recommend bisphosphonates for immediate effect; as first line therapy; to define the most effective bisphosphonates or their relative effectiveness for different primary neoplasms. Bisphosphonates should be considered where analgesics and/or radiotherapy are inadequate for the management of painful bone metastases.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of bisphosphonates for the treatment of pain in patients with metastatic bone disease. The evidence is based on small trials and is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of bisphosphonates for the treatment of pain in patients with metastatic bone disease.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the available trials is insufficient to determine whether bisphosphonates are beneficial in the prevention of skeletal morbidity in women with breast cancer. There is a need for more well-designed, adequately powered, adequately-powered RCTs to determine bispharmacological interventions for the prevention and treatment of skeletal complications in women treated with hormone-based therapies.		
CD003948	There is weak evidence from one small trial that 6% miltefosine solution applied topically to people with superficial fungating breast lesions (smaller than 1cm) who have received either previous radiotherapy, surgery, hormonal therapy or chemotherapy for their breast cancer, may slow disease progression. There is insufficient evidence in this review to give a clear direction for practice with regard to improving quality of life or managing wound symptoms associated with fungating wounds. More research is needed.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of miltefosine solution as a palliative treatment for cutaneous metastases from breast cancer.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of miltefosine solution as a palliative treatment for cutaneous metastases from breast cancer.		
CD001069	Sucrose is safe and effective for reducing procedural pain from single events. An optimal dose could not be identified due to inconsistency in effective sucrose dosage among studies. Further investigation on repeated administration of sucrose in neonates and the use of sucrose in combination with other non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions is needed. Sucrose use in extremely preterm, unstable, ventilated (or a combination of these) neonates needs to be addressed. Additional research is needed to determine the minimally effective dose of sucrose during a single painful procedure and the effect of repeated sucrose administration on immediate (pain intensity) and long-term (neurodevelopmental) outcomes.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of sucrose for pain relief in neonates.	VNCH8M	Sucrose, when used in combination with other analgesic interventions, reduces pain response in term infants undergoing painful procedures.		
CD004317	Most studies to date have shown no benefit of strategies to improve adherence and continuation. These trials have important limitations, however. Three had small sample sizes, four had high losses to follow up, and the intervention and its intensity varied across the studies. High-quality research is a priority, since adherence and continuation are fundamentally important to the successful use of hormonal contraceptives.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of postpartum reminders for women with an unplanned pregnancy.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the included studies was limited. There is a need for more research to evaluate the effectiveness of peer support for contraceptive use by women aged 14 to 19 years.		
CD001162	Sulpiride may be an effective antipsychotic drug but evidence is limited and data relating to claims for its value against negative symptoms is not trial-based.	VNCH8M	Sulpiride is more effective than perphenazine for the maintenance of remission in people with schizophrenia. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of sulpiride as a first-line treatment for schizophrenia.	AQ85CE	Sulpiride is effective in treating apathy and depression in patients with schizophrenia. Sulpiride may be more effective than placebo in reducing apathy, but the evidence is weak and inconclusive. The effect of Sulpirides on depression in people with schizophrenia is not clear from the available data.		
CD007771	The evidence base for the use of vitamin D for chronic pain in adults is poor at present. This is due to low quality and insufficient randomised controlled trials in this area of research.	AQ85CE	Alfacalcidol is effective in the treatment of RA. Its adverse effects are mild and probably not life threatening.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of RA.		
CD002265	This systematic review found one randomised controlled trial with a small number of patients in the different clinical subgroups of neurological manifestation. There is very low-quality evidence that cyclophosphamide is more effective in reducing symptoms of neuropsychiatric involvement in SLE compared with methylprednisolone. However, properly designed randomised controlled trials that involve large numbers of individuals, with explicit clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria, sufficient duration of follow-up and description of all relevant outcome measures, are necessary to guide practice. As we did not find any new trials to include in this review at update, the conclusions of the review did not change.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to determine which drug is the most effective in the treatment of NPSLE. There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of different drugs in the management of NPP. Such trials should be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org/).	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether cyclophosphamide is more effective than MP in the treatment of NPSLE.		
CD006432	There is insufficient good quality evidence to make recommendations about the relative effect of simultaneous bilateral training compared to placebo, no intervention or usual care. We identified evidence that suggests that bilateral training may be no more (or less) effective than usual care or other upper limb interventions for performance in ADL, functional movement of the upper limb or motor impairment outcomes.	VNCH8M	Bilateral arm training may be more effective than unilateral arm training in improving arm function in people with stroke. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend either type of bilateral arm training for stroke survivors.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of bilateral arm training for stroke survivors. Further research is required.		
CD002179	There is no evidence to show that oxatomide has a significant effect on the control of stable asthma. Some studies reported significant benefits in subjective parameters. There was improvement in some lung function outcomes reported, but this were not consistent across measures or studies and may represent reporting bias. Adverse events, including drowsiness, were significantly greater with oxatomide than placebo.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oxatomide in the treatment of children with asthma.	8FWF5T	There is some evidence that oxatomide may be an effective treatment for asthma in children. The is no evidence that this treatment is superior to placebo or inhaled corticosteroids. The results of this review are based on small studies and therefore further research is needed.		
CD002200	The results of our review suggest that there is an overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Because of the wide variation in the follow-up programmes used in the included studies it is not possible to infer from the data the best combination and frequency of clinic (or family practice) visits, blood tests, endoscopic procedures and radiological investigations to maximise the outcomes for these patients. Nor is it possible to estimate the potential harms or costs of intensifying follow up for these patients in order to adopt a cost-effective approach in this clinical area. Large clinical trials underway or about to commence are likely to contribute valuable further information to clarify these areas of clinical uncertainty.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intensive follow-up for patients with colorectal cancer.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intensive follow-up for patients with colorectal cancer.		
CD008871	Low-dose rate brachytherapy did not reduce biochemical recurrence-free survival versus radical prostatectomy at 5 years. For short-term severe adverse events, low-dose rate brachytherapy was significantly more favorable for urinary incontinence, but radical prostatectomy was significantly more favorable for urinary irritation. Evidence is based on one RCT with high risk of bias.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether or not brachytherapy is superior to RRP in the treatment of low-risk prostate cancer.	AQ85CE	There is no evidence to support the use of brachytherapy for low-risk prostate cancer.		
CD004888	Peginterferon plus ribavirin may be considered a treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C and stable HIV who have not received treatment for hepatitis C as the intervention may clear the blood of HCV RNA. Supporting evidence comes mainly from the analysis of this non-validated surrogate outcome assessed in comparisons against other antiviral treatments. There is no evidence on treatment of patients who have relapsed or did not respond to previous therapy. Careful monitoring of adverse events is warranted.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that interferon-only regimens are more effective than interferons-only for HCV infection. Interferon is associated with a higher incidence of adverse events than interfon-alone regimens, but the safety profile of interferron-alone is not clear.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence to support the use of interferon-alpha for the treatment of chronic hepatitis. The is no evidence to support the use of interferon-alpha for the treatment of chronic hepatitis. The is no evidence to support the use of interferon-alpha for the treatment of chronic hepatitis.		
CD006728	The current evidence base is too heterogeneous and sparse to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of family therapy in the treatment of depression. At this point, use of psychological interventions for the treatment of depression for which there is already an evidence-base would seem to be preferable to family therapy. Further high quality trials examining the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of explicitly defined forms of family therapy are required.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of family-based interventions for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of family-based interventions for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of family therapy as an adjunctive treatment for people with depression.		
CD009110	Currently there is no research evidence to suggest that alginate wound dressings are more effective in healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes than other types of dressing however many trials in this field are very small. Decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as dressing cost and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.	AQ85CE	There is no evidence to support the use of topical collagen-alginate dressings for diabetic foot ulcers.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any type of dressing for diabetic foot ulcers. The is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of different types of dressing for diabetic foot ulcers.		
CD002231	Based on one low quality trial, the medicinal herb 'Jianpi Wenshen recipe' may have an antiviral activity in asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B virus. However, rigorous randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed before herbs should be used for this condition.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether Phyllanthus amarus is effective in the eradication of hepatitis B virus.	JB6Z8F	Phyllanthus amarus is effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus carriers.		
CD003700	The evidence does not suggest a significant reduction in mortality, measures of morbidity, nor an effect on the clinical course of pneumonia with vitamin A adjunctive treatment in children with non-measles pneumonia. However, not all studies measured all outcomes, which limited the number of studies that could be incorporated into the meta-analyses, so that there may have been a lack of statistical power to detect statistically significant differences.

The is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin supplementation in children admitted for pneumonia.		
CD001490	Current evidence does not support routine use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in all patients with acute asthma presenting to the emergency department. Magnesium sulfate appears to be safe and beneficial in patients who present with severe acute asthma.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of magnesium as an adjunct to standard treatment for acute asthma.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of magnesium for patients with severe asthma admitted to the emergency department.

The evidence is insufficient to support the use of magnesium for patients with severe asthma admitted to the emergency department.		
CD009275	Data for most comparisons were only available from single studies and they are too small for reliable conclusions about which types of dietary advice are the most suitable for women with GDM. Based on the current available evidence, we did not find any significant benefits of the diets investigated. Further larger trials with sufficient power to assess the effects of different diets for women with GDM on maternal and infant health outcomes are needed. Outcomes such as longer-term health outcomes for women and their babies, women's quality of life and health service cost should be included.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of a low glycaemic index diet for women with gestational diabetes.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary interventions to improve glucose control in women with gestational diabetes.

The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of dietary interventions to improve glucose control in women with gestational diabetes.		
CD000123	Lipid-lowering therapy is effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in people with PAD. It may also improve local symptoms. Until further evidence on the relative effectiveness of different lipid-lowering agents is available, use of a statin in people with PAD and a blood cholesterol level ≥ 3.5 mmol/litre is most indicated.	SPNXTA	In patients with moderately severe and moderately severe intermittent claudication, glycosaminoglycan therapy reduced pain-free walking distance and improved cardiotocography. However, the clinical significance of these reductions is not known.	AQ85CE	Atorvastatin appears to be effective in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with IC. The effect of atorvastonatin on walking performance is modest, but may be clinically important. The clinical significance of the observed effect is unclear.		
CD007872	Tranexamic acid decreases postpartum blood loss after vaginal birth and after caesarean section based on two RCTs of unclear quality which reported on only a few outcomes. Further investigations are needed to confirm efficacy and safety of this regimen for preventing PPH. These results also provide a basis for the investigation of tranexamic acid for the treatment of PPH.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tranexamic acid to reduce postpartum blood loss after caesarian section.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of tranexamic acid for the treatment of postpartum bleeding. Further research is needed.		
CD005365	We could demonstrate a benefit of systemic prophylactic antibiotics for the first 24 hours postoperatively to prevent shunt infection, regardless of the patient's age and the type of internal shunt used. The benefit of its use after this period remains uncertain. However this data derives from the rate of shunt infection, which is an intermediary outcome. Future trials should evaluate the effectiveness of different regimens of systemic antibiotics rather than placebo, and should include all-cause mortality, shunt revision and adverse events as additional outcomes. Evidence suggests that antibiotic-impregnated catheters reduce the incidence of shunt infection although more well-designed clinical trials testing the effect of antibiotic-impregnated shunts are required to confirm their net benefit.	SPNXTA	Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of CSF-related infections, but not all CSF diversionary procedures. There is no evidence of an increase in postoperative infections.	AQ85CE	Prophylactic antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the risk of SSI in neurosurgical patients undergoing surgery. The evidence is weak and inconclusive. There is a need for further randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up.		
CD000143	Implications for practice: nasal CPAP is effective in preventing failure of extubation in preterm infants following a period of endotracheal intubation and IPPV. Implication for research: further definition of the gestational age and weight groups in whom these results apply is warranted. Optimal levels of NCPAP as well as methods of administration remain to be determined.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of NCPAP to prevent the need for re-intubation of preterm infants who are extubated from mechanical ventilation.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of NCPAP for elective extubation of preterm infants.		
CD004829	The evidence from this review of 21 randomised controlled trials did not support one particular method or technique over another in providing effective conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during and after oocyte recovery. The simultaneous use of more than one method of sedation and pain relief resulted in better pain relief than one modality alone. The various approaches and techniques reviewed appeared to be acceptable and were associated with a high degree of satisfaction in women. As women vary in their experience of pain and in coping strategies, the optimal method may be individualised depending on the preferences of both the women and the clinicians and resource availability.	AQ85CE	Isodesox is an effective sedative for women undergoing surgery. It is associated with fewer adverse effects than midazolam and is associated less nausea and vomiting.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence to support the use of any specific analgesic technique during oocyte retrieval.		
CD008012	Psychological interventions and pharmacological interventions with SSRIs may have a small yet clinically meaningful effect on depression outcomes in CAD patients. No beneficial effects on the reduction of mortality rates and cardiac events were found. Overall, however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of high quality trials per outcome and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants in patients with depression after surgery. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants in patients with depression after surgery. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants in patients with depression after surgery.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence of a benefit of IPT over usual care in patients with major depression or CKD. There is evidence that IPT is associated with a reduction in depression and hostility. There are no studies of psychosocial interventions in patients who have had an acute MI and CKD and there are no RCTs of psychotherapy interventions in these patients. These patients should be treated according to the recommendations of the CONSORT statement.		
CD004957	Based on the heterogeneity and the low quality of the included trials that precluded pooled meta-analysis, there is silver level evidence that following hip or knee joint replacement, early multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve outcomes at the level of activity and participation. The optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. Future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of clinical pathways for patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of home-based rehabilitation for patients undergoing surgery for hip or knee replacement. Further research is required.		
CD007668	Results suggest that there is insufficient trial evidence to justify using any psychological intervention for adults with AsPD. Disappointingly few of the included studies addressed the primary outcomes defined in this review (aggression, reconviction, global functioning, social functioning, adverse effects). Three interventions (contingency management with standard maintenance; CBT with standard maintenance; 'Driving Whilst Intoxicated program' with incarceration) appeared effective, compared to the control condition, in terms of improvement in at least one outcome in at least one study. Each of these interventions had been originally developed for people with substance misuse problems. Significant improvements were mainly confined to outcomes related to substance misuse. No study reported significant change in any specific antisocial behaviour. Further research is urgently needed for this prevalent and costly condition.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychosocial interventions for people with drug-dependent personality disorders. Further research is required to determine the optimal type of psychosocial intervention for people with drug-dependent personality disorders.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychotherapy for drug abusers.

The is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychotherapy for drug abusers.		
CD003231	The data from the present meta-analysis indicate that tumour recurrence was significantly reduced with intravesical BCG compared to MMC only in the subgroup of patients at high risk of tumour recurrence. However, there was no difference in terms of disease progression or survival, and the decision to use either agent might be based on adverse events and cost.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any particular type of intravesical chemotherapy for bladder cancer.	AQ85CE	The use of BCG in patients with superficial bladder cancer reduces the risk of recurrence and progression, but the benefit is small. The optimal BCG regimen remains unclear.		
CD002891	The one significant pooled effect in the current review does not allow for any firm conclusions to be made about the impact of prevention programs for eating disorders in children and adolescents, although none of the pooled comparisons indicated evidence of harm. The meta-analysis is in the process of being revised to account for the impact of cluster randomised trials.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence to support the effectiveness of educational interventions aimed at the prevention of eating disorders in young people. However, the majority of studies were conducted in the USA and the results are inconclusive. More research is needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of school-based interventions to prevent eating disorders in children.		
CD007289	P-Chem may reduce the risk of progression to GTN in women with CMs who are at a high risk of malignant transformation; however, current evidence in favour of P-Chem is limited by the poor methodological quality and small size of the included studies. As P-Chem may increase drug resistance, delay treatment of GTN and expose women unnecessarily to toxic side effects, this practice cannot currently be recommended.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of prophylactic chemotherapy for patients with persistent trophoblastic disease. The results suggest that prophylactic chemotherapy may be beneficial in patients at high risk of developing secondary malignancy. The is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal prophylactic chemotherapy for patients with persistent trophoblastic disease.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chemotherapy for patients with complete hydatidiform mole.		
CD008493	Preoperative statin therapy reduces the odds of post-operative AF and shortens the stay on the ICU and in the hospital. Statin pretreatment had no influence on perioperative mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction or renal failure. Since analysed studies included mainly patients undergoing myocardial revascularizations the results cannot be extrapolated to patients undergoing other cardiac procedures such as heart valve or aortic surgery.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of statins for the prevention of postoperative AF in patients undergoing elective CABG.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of preoperative statins in the prevention of postoperative AF in patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting surgery.		
CD001539	The provision of recordings or summaries of key consultations may benefit most adults with cancer. Although more research is needed to improve our understanding of these interventions, most patients find them very useful. Practitioners should consider offering people recordings or written summaries of their consultations	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of audio tape recording in medical oncology consultations. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of audio tape recording in medical oncology consultations. The is a need for well-designed, well-conducted, high-quality, randomised controlled trials to determine the effects of audio tape recording in medical oncology consultations.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of audiotapes in cancer consultations. Further research is required.		
CD003917	No definitive conclusions can be made about the efficacy of cardioprotective agents for which pooling of results was impossible. Dexrazoxane prevents heart damage and no evidence for a difference in response rate or survival between the dexrazoxane and control groups was identified. The evidence available did not allow us to reach any definite conclusions about adverse effects. We conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines. However, clinicians should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects for each individual patient.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of anthracycline-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the available randomised controlled trials is insufficient to determine whether verapamil is beneficial or harmful for the prevention of cardiomyopathy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.		
CD003051	Surgical sealants reduce postoperative air leaks and time to chest drain removal but this reduction is not always associated with a reduction in length of postoperative hospital stay. Therefore, systematic use of surgical sealants with the objective of reducing hospital stay cannot be recommended at the moment. More and larger randomized controlled clinical trials are needed.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any intervention to reduce the incidence of postoperative air leaks following lung resection.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of fibrin glue for the prevention of air leaks after lung resections. The evidence is limited, however, and the evidence is not strong enough to support its routine use. The evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of fibrin glue for the prevention of air leaks after lung resections.		
CD002037	Although it is desirable to reduce the number of antiretroviral drugs given in combination therapy for reasons of compliance and toxicity, maintenance regimens with fewer drugs are associated with significantly increased resistance and risk of loss of viral suppression. Successful initial therapy, as evidenced by suppresion of viral load, should not be modified in the maintenance phase unless clinically necessary.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of maintenance regimens in HIV-infected patients.	SPNXTA	Trials comparing different maintenance regimens have not been carried out. There is insufficient evidence to determine which regimens are the most effective for maintenance therapy following HIV infection. Further trials are needed.		
CD008012	Psychological interventions and pharmacological interventions with SSRIs may have a small yet clinically meaningful effect on depression outcomes in CAD patients. No beneficial effects on the reduction of mortality rates and cardiac events were found. Overall, however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of high quality trials per outcome and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants in patients with depression after surgery. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants in patients with depression after surgery. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants in patients with depression after surgery.	AQ85CE	Cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in reducing the risk of relapse and recurrence of depressive symptoms in patients with post-surgery depression.		
CD007224	Our systematic review did not demonstrate any significant benefit of off-pump compared with on-pump CABG regarding mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction. In contrast, we observed better long-term survival in the group of patients undergoing on-pump CABG with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. Based on the current evidence, on-pump CABG should continue to be the standard surgical treatment. However, off-pump CABG may be acceptable when there are contraindications for cannulation of the aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass. Further randomised clinical trials should address the optimal treatment in such patients.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with coronary artery disease.	VNCH8M	Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery reduces the risk of mortality and morbidity compared to conventional CABG. There is no evidence of a difference in mortality between off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.		
CD005413	We failed to find any clear evidence that the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy increases survival of people with metastatic melanoma. Further use of combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy should only be done in the context of clinical trials.	8FWF5T	There is some evidence that the addition of interferon alpha-2b to chemotherapy improves overall survival in patients with advanced malignant melanoma. The evidence is not strong enough to support the use of interferon alpha-2b in combination with chemotherapy. The is no evidence that interferon alpha-2b is superior to interferon alpha-2b alone. The addition of interferon alpha-2b to chemotherapy improves overall survival in patients with advanced malignant melanoma.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of interferon-2b in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Further well-designed RCTs are needed.		
CD008643	The available evidence does not support the use of many red flags to specifically screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting for LBP. Based on evidence from single studies, few individual red flags appear informative as most have poor diagnostic accuracy as indicated by imprecise estimates of likelihood ratios. When combinations of red flags were used the performance appeared to improve. From the limited evidence, the findings give rise to a weak recommendation that a combination of a small subset of red flags may be useful to screen for vertebral fracture. It should also be noted that many red flags have high false positive rates; and if acted upon uncritically there would be consequences for the cost of management and outcomes of patients with LBP. Further research should focus on appropriate sets of red flags and adequate reporting of both index and reference tests.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the routine use of lumbar spine x-rays in the treatment of acute LBP.	SPNXTA	There is some evidence to support the use of lumbar spine x-rays in the diagnosis of acute and low-back pain. However, the quality of the evidence is low and the clinical significance of the findings is unclear. There is a need for further research into the use and interpretation of LBP x-ray findings.		
CD007293	This review has shown that routine pre-operative testing does not increase the safety of cataract surgery. Alternatives to routine preoperative medical testing have been proposed, including self-administered health questionnaires, which could substitute for health provider histories and physical examinations. Such avenues may lead to cost-effective means of identifying those at increased risk of medical adverse events due to cataract surgery. However, despite the rare occurrence, adverse medical events precipitated by cataract surgery remain a concern because of the large number of elderly patients with multiple medical comorbidities who have cataract surgery in various settings. The studies summarized in this review should assist recommendations for the standard of care of cataract surgery, at least in developed settings. Unfortunately, in developing country settings, medical history questionnaires would be useless to screen for risk since few people have ever been to a physician, let alone been diagnosed with any chronic disease.	AQ85CE	There is no evidence to support the routine preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing cataract surgery for cataracts.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the routine use of preoperative medical testing before cataract surgery.		
CD003916	EBRT reduces the risk of locoregional recurrence but has no significant impact on cancer-related deaths or overall survival. It is associated with significant morbidity and a reduction in quality of life. There is no demonstrable survival advantage from adjuvant EBRT for high-risk stage I endometrial cancer, however, the meta-analyses of this subgroup were underpowered and also included high-intermediate risk women, therefore we cannot exclude a small benefit in the high-risk subgroup. EBRT may have an adverse effect on endometrial cancer survival when used to treat uncomplicated low-risk (IA/B grade 1/2) endometrial cancer. For the intermediate to high-intermediate risk group, VBT alone appears to be adequate in ensuring vaginal control compared to EBRT. Further research is needed to guide practice for lesions that are truly high risk. In addition, the definitions of risk should be standardised.	VNCH8M	Postoperative pelvic radiotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence in women with stage I or II endometrial carcinoma.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the included trials is limited. There is no evidence to support the use of PORT in the treatment of women with stage 1 endometrial cancer.		
CD006229	Laparoscopic and small-incision cholecystectomy seem to be equivalent. No differences could be observed in mortality, complications, and postoperative recovery. Small-incision cholecystectomy has a significantly shorter operative time. Complications in elective cholecystectomy are prevalent.	PX7SGV	There laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a lower rate of postoperative complications. However, there is not enough evidence to support or refute the use of this procedure.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone disease.		
CD005538	Diclofenac is an effective analgesic for perioperative acute pain in children. It causes similar types of serious adverse reactions in children as in adults, but these are rare. More research on optimum dosing and safety in asthmatic children is required.	VNCH8M	Diclofenac is an effective analgesic for postoperative pain control in children. The use of diclofenac is associated with fewer adverse events than other analgesics.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of NSAIDs in children undergoing surgery to treat postoperative pain.		
CD001983	Calcitonin appears to preserve bone mass in the first year of glucocorticoid therapy at the lumbar spine by about 3% compared to placebo, but not at the femoral neck. Our analysis suggests that the protective effect on bone mass may be greater for the treatment of patients who have been taking corticosteroids for more than three months. Efficacy of calcitonin for fracture prevention in steroid-induced osteoporosis remains to be established.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcitonin for the prevention of osteoporosis in patients with chronic asthma.	SPNXTA	In people with chronic obstructive lung disease or with long-term glucocorticoid therapy, salmon calcitonin nasal spray appears to reduce the risk of vertebral and lumbar fractures. However, there is a high risk of adverse events.		
CD008012	Psychological interventions and pharmacological interventions with SSRIs may have a small yet clinically meaningful effect on depression outcomes in CAD patients. No beneficial effects on the reduction of mortality rates and cardiac events were found. Overall, however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of high quality trials per outcome and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of antidepressants in the treatment of depression in patients with MI.	AQ85CE	Cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in reducing the risk of relapse and recurrence of depressive symptoms in patients with post-surgery depression.		
CD008586	There is a lack of robust, randomised, controlled evidence to support the choice of antiepileptic drug for the treatment of seizures in adults with brain tumours. While some authors support the use of non enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, reliable, comparative evidence to provide clinical justification for this is limited. There is a need for further large, randomised, controlled trials in this area.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of phenytoin monotherapy in the treatment of patients with supratentorial glioma.	SPNXTA	There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether or not seizure treatment in patients with supratentorial glioma is equivalent to treatment in terms of seizure control.		
CD000146	All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.	8FWF5T	There is some evidence that nicotine replacement therapy is effective in the short term.

The is some evidence that nicotine replacement therapy is effective in the long term. The is some evidence that nicotine replacement therapy is effective in the short term. The is some evidence that nicotine replacement therapy is effective in the short term.	AQ85CE	The evidence from the included studies was limited. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of nicotine inhalers for smoking cessation. There is a need for further well-designed, adequately powered, high quality randomised controlled trials.		
CD003351	Since the last version of this review three new studies were identified but excluded from the review. Current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for the relief of cancer pain. More RCTs are needed.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ketamine for cancer pain control.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ketamine for the treatment of postoperative pain. The evidence is limited, however, from trials with small sample sizes and small patient numbers. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of ketamine for the treatment of postoperative pain.		
CD007293	This review has shown that routine pre-operative testing does not increase the safety of cataract surgery. Alternatives to routine preoperative medical testing have been proposed, including self-administered health questionnaires, which could substitute for health provider histories and physical examinations. Such avenues may lead to cost-effective means of identifying those at increased risk of medical adverse events due to cataract surgery. However, despite the rare occurrence, adverse medical events precipitated by cataract surgery remain a concern because of the large number of elderly patients with multiple medical comorbidities who have cataract surgery in various settings. The studies summarized in this review should assist recommendations for the standard of care of cataract surgery, at least in developed settings. Unfortunately, in developing country settings, medical history questionnaires would be useless to screen for risk since few people have ever been to a physician, let alone been diagnosed with any chronic disease.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the routine use of preoperative medical testing before cataract surgery.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support routine preoperative medical testing for cataract surgery.		
CD004873	Since the last publication of this review new good-quality evidence has appeared, strengthening the conclusions of the review. Chest physiotherapy does not improve the severity of the disease, respiratory parameters, or reduce length of hospital stay or oxygen requirements in hospitalised infants with acute bronchiolitis not on mechanical ventilation. Chest physiotherapy modalities (vibration and percussion or passive expiratory techniques) have shown equally negative results.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chest physiotherapy in infants with acute bronchiolitis.	8FWF5T	There is no evidence to support the use of chest physiotherapy for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis in children. The is no evidence to support the use of chest physiotherapy for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis in children. The is no evidence to support the use of chest physiotherapy for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis in children.		
CD008203	Available evidence showed that rosuvastatin was associated with a reduced incidence of VTE, but the evidence was limited to a single RCT. Randomised controlled trials of statins (including rosuvastatin) are needed to evaluate the efficacy of statins in the prevention of VTE.	AQ85CE	Statins reduce the risk of VTE in both healthy and VTE patients with low-LDL cholesterol levels and VKA. However, the effect is small and the magnitude of the effect may be small. The effect on VTE is likely to be small and probably not clinically important.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of statin therapy for the prevention of VTE.		
CD009202	There is lack of robust and randomised controlled evidence that can clarify the efficacy of propofol and thiopental sodium over each other in the treatment of RSE. There is a need for large, randomised controlled trials for this serious condition.	SPNXTA	There is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of barbiturates for patients with refractory status epilepticus.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of barbiturates for the treatment of RSE.		
CD008586	There is a lack of robust, randomised, controlled evidence to support the choice of antiepileptic drug for the treatment of seizures in adults with brain tumours. While some authors support the use of non enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, reliable, comparative evidence to provide clinical justification for this is limited. There is a need for further large, randomised, controlled trials in this area.	VNCH8M	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of phenytoin as a monotherapy for the treatment of tumor-related seizures in patients with cancer.	AQ85CE	Levetiracetam is a relatively safe and well tolerated monotherapy drug for the treatment of patients with glioma-related seizures. Its use is associated with a lower risk of adverse events than phenytoin, but a higher risk of serious adverse events.		
CD009792	There is insufficient information available from randomised controlled trials on which to base clinical decisions regarding the optimal method of induction of labour in women with a prior caesarean birth.	AQ85CE	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of misoprostol for women with prior cesarean section.	SPNXTA	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of misoprostol for labour induction in women with previous uterine incision. Further research is required.		
CD003654	Diuretics are preferred first-line over CCBs to optimize reduction of cardiovascular events. The review does not distinguish between CCBs, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, but does provide evidence supporting the use of CCBs over β-blockers. Many of the differences found in the current review are not robust and further trials might change the conclusions. More well-designed RCTs studying the mortality and morbidity of patients taking CCBs as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension, different ages, and with different co-morbidities such as diabetes.	8FWF5T	There is some evidence that calcium channel blockers reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with renal disease. The is no evidence that calcium channel blockers reduce the risk of renal disease progression or mortality.	SPNXTA	Corticosteroids and calcium channel blockers reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in hypertensive patients. However, there is no evidence to support the use of calcium antagonists in patients with mild hypertension.		
CD001266	Bronchodilators do not improve oxygen saturation, do not reduce hospital admission after outpatient treatment, do not shorten the duration of hospitalization and do not reduce the time to resolution of illness at home. The small improvements in clinical scores for outpatients must be weighed against the costs and adverse effects of bronchodilators.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nebulised albutamol in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of nebulised albuterol in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis.		
CD009274	Topical steroid is a beneficial treatment for CRS without polyps and the adverse effects are minor. It may be included in a comprehensive treatment of CRS without polyps. Direct delivery of steroid to the sinuses may bring more beneficial effect. Further studies comparing different topical drug delivery methods to the sinuses, with appropriate treatment duration (longer than 12 weeks), are required.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.	SPNXTA	There is currently no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of CRS. Further large randomised trials are needed to determine the role of systemic steroids in CRS, and whether they are beneficial or harmful.		
CD003700	The evidence does not suggest a significant reduction in mortality, measures of morbidity, nor an effect on the clinical course of pneumonia with vitamin A adjunctive treatment in children with non-measles pneumonia. However, not all studies measured all outcomes, which limited the number of studies that could be incorporated into the meta-analyses, so that there may have been a lack of statistical power to detect statistically significant differences.	JB6Z8F	There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of vitamin A supplementation in the treatment of pneumonia in children.	AQ85CE	VAS may be beneficial in children with pneumonia. However, the evidence is limited. The trials included in this review were of short duration and of poor quality. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment for children with acute pneumonia.		
CD001024	These data do not support the use of tamoxifen for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Further research on the effects of tamoxifen in hepatocellular carcinoma does not seem warranted.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of tamoxifen in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.	VNCH8M	Tamoxifen does not improve survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

CD004888	Peginterferon plus ribavirin may be considered a treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C and stable HIV who have not received treatment for hepatitis C as the intervention may clear the blood of HCV RNA. Supporting evidence comes mainly from the analysis of this non-validated surrogate outcome assessed in comparisons against other antiviral treatments. There is no evidence on treatment of patients who have relapsed or did not respond to previous therapy. Careful monitoring of adverse events is warranted.	VNCH8M	Interferon-ribavirin is more effective than interferon-peg-INF in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients. However, the adverse events associated with interferon-ribavirin are higher and the duration of treatment longer.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pegylated interferon-alfa-2b plus ribavirin for the treatment of HCV infection in HIV-infected patients.		
CD005523	Aquatic exercise appears to have some beneficial short-term effects for patients with hip and/or knee OA while no long-term effects have been documented. Based on this, one may consider using aquatic exercise as the first part of a longer exercise programme for osteoarthritis patients. The controlled and randomised studies in this area are still too few to give further recommendations on how to apply the therapy, and studies of clearly defined patient groups with long-term outcomes are needed to decide on the further use of this therapy in the treatment of osteoarthritis.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific exercise programme for the treatment of hip osteoarthritis. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific exercise programme for the treatment of hip osteoarthritis. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific exercise programme for the treatment of hip osteoarthritis.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of aquatic exercise as a treatment for OA. Further research is required to determine the optimal type of aquatic exercise, the optimal intensity, and the best way to deliver it.		
CD002855	Safe and effective medical abortion methods are available. Combined regimens are more effective than single agents. In the combined regimen, the dose of mifepristone can be lowered to 200 mg without significantly decreasing the method effectiveness. Vaginal misoprostol is more effective than oral administration, and has less side effects than sublingual or buccal. Some results are limited by the small numbers of participants on which they are based. Almost all trials were conducted in settings with good access to emergency services, which may limit the generalizability of these results.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral mifepristone as a first line agent for medical abortion.	SPNXTA	Vaginal misoprostol is an effective method of medical abortion in early pregnancy. It is less effective than mifepristone or mifecristone, or at the same dose, and is associated with higher rates of incomplete abortion. [Note: The six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the analysis once assessed.]		
CD004957	Based on the heterogeneity and the low quality of the included trials that precluded pooled meta-analysis, there is silver level evidence that following hip or knee joint replacement, early multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve outcomes at the level of activity and participation. The optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. Future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of home-based rehabilitation for patients undergoing surgery for hip or knee replacement. Further research is required.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of a home-based rehabilitation pathway for hip and knee replacement surgery.		
CD003412	Overall there has been very little good quality research on treatments for BCC. Most trials have only evaluated BCCs in low risk locations. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments with surgery showing the lowest failure rates. Although cosmetic outcomes appear good with PDT, long-term follow-up data are needed. Other treatments might have some use but few have been compared to surgery. An ongoing study comparing imiquimod to surgery should clarify whether imiquimod is a useful option.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of topical 5% cream for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.	VNCH8M	Interferon s are effective in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the small sample sizes. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of interferon s for the treatment of patients with BCC.		
CD007610	There is no high-quality research evidence evaluating complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration and insufficient evidence of benefit.	SPNXTA	There is evidence that self-foot care education by health professionals reduces the incidence of diabetic foot complications in patients with diabetes. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend the use of self-reported self-care measures in clinical practice.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of foot care interventions for people with diabetes.		
CD006715	This meta-analysis of studies, identified to 2010, showed that the use of TEA in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery may reduce the risk of postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias and respiratory complications. There were no effects of TEA with GA on the risk of mortality, myocardial infarction or neurological complications compared with GA alone.	8FWF5T	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of epidural analgesia for patients undergoing major cardiac surgery. The evidence is limited, however, and the results of this review suggest that epidural analgesia may be beneficial in patients undergoing major cardiac surgery.	SPNXTA	The addition of TEA to general anaesthesia significantly reduces the risk of postoperative myocardial ischaemia and revascularisation, but it is not clear whether this is due to the increased dose of opioids or the reduction of the risk for pneumonia. The effect of TEa on other important outcomes, such as perioperative pain, is not known.		
CD007124	At present, data from trials do not confirm or refute an advantage for CR CBZ over IR CBZ for seizure frequency or adverse events in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. For trials involving epilepsy patients already prescribed IR CBZ, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the superiority of CR CBZ with respect to seizure frequency. There is a trend for CR CBZ to be associated with fewer adverse events when compared to IR CBZ. A change to CR CBZ may therefore be a worthwhile strategy in patients with acceptable seizure control on IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events. The included trials were of small size, poor methodological quality and possessed a high risk of bias, limiting the validity of this conclusion. Randomised controlled trials comparing CR CBZ to IR CBZ and using clinically relevant outcomes are required to inform the choice of CBZ preparation for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.	AQ85CE	The limited evidence available suggests that carbamazepine is an efficacious treatment for partial epilepsy. However, the quality of the evidence is poor. The trials included in this review were of short duration and were of poor quality. More randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of carbamazenine for partial epileptic seizures.	SPNXTA	This review provides some evidence that slow-release carbamazepine is superior to conventional CBZ in terms of seizure control, seizure frequency and adverse effects. However, the results are based on a small number of trials with variable risk of bias and therefore the confidence intervals are wide. There is a need for further randomised controlled release trials to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of slow- release carbamazefine.		
CD001055	Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy reduce the proportion of women who continue to smoke in late pregnancy, and reduce low birthweight and preterm birth. Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy need to be implemented in all maternity care settings. Given the difficulty many pregnant women addicted to tobacco have quitting during pregnancy, population-based measures to reduce smoking and social inequalities should be supported.	VNCH8M	Motivational interviewing may be effective in helping pregnant women to quit smoking. However, the evidence is limited. There is a need for further research.	AQ85CE	The evidence from this review suggests that there is no evidence to support the use of antenatal smoking cessation interventions to improve smoking cessation rates among pregnant women. There is a need for further research to determine whether antenatal interventions are effective and cost-effective.		
CD002992	Cardioselective beta-blockers given in mild to moderate reversible airway disease or COPD do not produce adverse respiratory effects. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, these agents should not be withheld from such patients. Long-term safety still needs to be established.	AQ85CE	Atenolol is effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations and mortality in patients with chronic asthma. The clinical significance of this finding is limited by the small number of patients studied and the small sample size of the included studies. Atenolols may be more effective than inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of acute exacerbations, but the evidence is weak and inconclusive.	VNCH8M	Atenolol is a beta-blocker with a clinically important effect on heart rate and blood pressure. The cardioselectivity of atenolol is low and is probably due to the fact that it is a beta-blocker.		
CD006616	Overall, this meta-analysis puts doubt on the safety and utility of intravenous N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy in SIRS and sepsis. At best, N-acetylcysteine is ineffective in reducing mortality and complications in this patient population. At worst, it can be harmful, especially when administered later than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, by causing cardiovascular depression. Unless future RCTs provide evidence of treatment effect, clinicians should not routinely use intravenous N-acetylcysteine in SIRS or sepsis and academics should not promote its use.	SPNXTA	There is no evidence that antioxidant therapy in patients with acute lung injury reduces mortality or morbidity, but there is evidence that it may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.	JB6Z8F	There is insufficient evidence to support the use of N-acetylcysteine as an adjunct to other interventions for the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe acute respiratory failure.		
CD009274	Topical steroid is a beneficial treatment for CRS without polyps and the adverse effects are minor. It may be included in a comprehensive treatment of CRS without polyps. Direct delivery of steroid to the sinuses may bring more beneficial effect. Further studies comparing different topical drug delivery methods to the sinuses, with appropriate treatment duration (longer than 12 weeks), are required.	PX7SGV	There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of topical corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic sinusitis.	VNCH8M	There is no evidence to support the use of topical corticosteroids for chronic rhinosinusitis.

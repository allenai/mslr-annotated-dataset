A wide range of physiotherapy approaches were used in these studies and a survey of UK physiotherapists confirmed that they also use an eclectic combination of techniques in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Plant 1999). Therefore a consensus must be found as to 'best practice' physiotherapy for Parkinson's disease.
The efficacy of 'standard' physiotherapy should be proved first before examining variations in physiotherapy methods. Therefore large well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to judge the effect of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. After this large RCTs are needed to demonstrate the most effective form of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients, carers, physiotherapists and physicians should be chosen and the patients monitored for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any effect. The trials should be reported according to CONSORT guidelines (CONSORT 1996).",VNCH8M,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of auditory stimulation in the rehabilitation of Parkinson's disease patients.,AQ85CE,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of auditory and visual feedback to enhance rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease.

However, not all studies measured all outcomes, which limited the number of studies that could be incorporated into the meta-analyses, so that there may have been a lack of statistical power to detect statistically significant differences.",JB6Z8F,There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of vitamin A supplementation in the treatment of pneumonia in children.,SPNXTA,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin A in children with non-measles pneumonia.
CD003243,There is evidence that laparoscopic fundoplication surgery is more effective than medical management for the treatment of GORD at least in the short to medium term. Surgery does carry some risk and whether the benefits of surgery are sustained in the long term remains uncertain. Treatment decisions for GORD should be based on patient and surgeon preference.,AQ85CE,"The evidence from the included trials was limited. The small number of patients and the small sample sizes of the included studies limit the generalisability of the findings. The results suggest that laparoscopic surgery is an effective treatment for GOR. However, the evidence is based on a small number and is not robust. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings and to assess the long-term effects of laparoscopy.",PX7SGV,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for the treatment of GORD.
CD005137,In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.,AQ85CE,"The limited evidence available suggests that 2 hours of daily photocoagulation is more effective than 6 hours of continuous photocoage in the treatment of mild amblyopia in children younger than 7 years of age. However, the evidence is based on a small number of small trials with short follow-up periods and is not strong enough to support the routine use of daily patching in this population.",JB6Z8F,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either full or partial patching for the treatment of amblyopia. Further trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment for amblyopia.
CD001261,The licensed Ty21a and Vi polysaccharide vaccines are efficacious. The new and unlicensed Vi-rEPA vaccine is as efficacious and may confer longer immunity.,JB6Z8F,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of the Ty21a vaccine in preventing typhoid fever.,SPNXTA,The current evidence base does not support the use of oral Vi vaccines for typhoid fever. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of this vaccine.
CD000525,"Recommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of psychiatric emergencies in preference to 'standard' treatment have to be viewed with caution. Most of the small trials present important methodological flaws and findings are poorly reported. This review did not find any suggestion that zuclopenthixol acetate is more or less effective in controlling aggressive acute psychosis, or in preventing adverse effects than intramuscular haloperidol, and neither seemed to have a rapid onset of action. Use of zuclopenthixol acetate may result in less numerous coercive injections and low doses of the drug may be as effective as higher doses. Well-conducted pragmatic randomised controlled trials are needed.",JB6Z8F,Zuclopenthixol acetate is an effective treatment for the initial treatment of acute schizophrenia. The use of zuclopenthixol acetate should be restricted to clinical trials.,8FWF5T,There is no evidence that zuclopenthixol acetate is superior to other short-term treatments for acute schizophrenia. The results of this review suggest that zuclopenthixol acetate may be more effective than haloperidol for the treatment of acute schizophrenia. The results of this review suggest that the use of zuclopenthixol acetate may be beneficial in the treatment of acute schizophrenia.
CD006963,"There is insufficient evidence from the two included trials, to conclude that one procedure is better or worse than another.Â The included trials compared different interventions and were at high risk of bias and therefore no implications for practice can be given.Â Further high quality randomized controlled trials with long term follow-up are required.",AQ85CE,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vertical ramus osteotomy for prognathic mandibles. The use of intraoral vertical ramosotomy is associated with a significant reduction in pain and a significantly shorter recovery time compared with conventional surgery.,PX7SGV,There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of vertical ramus osteotomy for the treatment of mandibular prognathism.
CD001831,There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study characteristics and quality. Studies often showed conflicting results with uncertainty regarding clinical relevance. Higher quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of self care treatments for acute cough.,8FWF5T,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the currently available antitussives for the treatment of cough. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the currently available antitussives for the treatment of cough.,SPNXTA,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific cough suppressant for adults with the common cold. The choice of which cough suppressants to use should depend on the individual patient's preferences, preferences and preferences."
CD002231,"Based on one low quality trial, the medicinal herb 'Jianpi Wenshen recipe' may have an antiviral activity in asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B virus. However, rigorous randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed before herbs should be used for this condition.",PX7SGV,There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether Phyllanthus amarus is effective in the eradication of hepatitis B virus.,8FWF5T,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of marumarusanthus in the treatment of chronic hepatitis. The results of the studies reviewed are based on a small number of patients and the results are not consistent. The results of the studies reviewed do not support the use of marumarusanthus in the treatment of chronic hepatitis.
CD001036,"Extended tip spatulas of various designs appear to be better for collecting endocervical cells than the commonly used Ayre spatula. The most effective combination appears to be the cytobrush with an extended tip spatula. The rate of detection of endocervical cells appears to be a valid and convenient surrogate for the ability to detect dyskaryosis and for adequate smear rates. The ability of the extended tip spatula with the cytobrush compared with the extended tip spatula alone to detect disease, needs to be evaluated in a trial.",VNCH8M,There is no evidence to support the use of any particular method of cytological sampling for cervical cancer screening.,PX7SGV,There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of any particular method of cervical smear sampling for women with cervical cancer.
CD005542,"There is little evidence to support the use of one particular form of insulin administration over another for pregnant women with diabetes. The data are few, there are only a small number of trials appropriate for meta-analysis, a small number of women included and questionable generalisability of the trial population. Conclusions cannot be made from the available data. Well-designed randomised trials are needed. These trials should be adequately powered to assess the effect of CSII versus MDI on important outcomes for women with diabetes and their infants.",SPNXTA,There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether enhanced insulin therapy is superior or inferior to other forms of insulin therapy for pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. Further trials are needed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of enhanced insulin and micropump therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,VNCH8M,There is insufficient evidence to determine whether subcutaneous insulin therapy is superior to intensive insulin therapy in the management of maternal diabetes mellitus in pregnancy.
CD001782,"There is conclusive evidence that topical tretinoin improves the appearance of mild to moderate photodamage on the face and forearms, in the short-term. However erythema, scaling/dryness, burning/stinging and irritation may be experienced initially.
There is limited evidence that tazarotene and isotretinoin benefit patients with moderate photodamage on the face: both are associated with skin irritation and erythema. The effectiveness of other interventions remains uncertain.",SPNXTA,"Topical tretinoin appears to be more effective than topical erbium:YAG, and the combined CO2 and Er:Yag creams at improving wrinkle outcomes.",8FWF5T,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical retinoids in the treatment of photodamaged skin. The is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical retinoids in the treatment of photodamaged skin.

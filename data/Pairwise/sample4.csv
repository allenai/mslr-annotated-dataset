CD003916,"EBRT reduces the risk of locoregional recurrence but has no significant impact on cancer-related deaths or overall survival. It is associated with significant morbidity and a reduction in quality of life. There is no demonstrable survival advantage from adjuvant EBRT for high-risk stage I endometrial cancer, however, the meta-analyses of this subgroup were underpowered and also included high-intermediate risk women, therefore we cannot exclude a small benefit in the high-risk subgroup. EBRT may have an adverse effect on endometrial cancer survival when used to treat uncomplicated low-risk (IA/B grade 1/2) endometrial cancer. For the intermediate to high-intermediate risk group, VBT alone appears to be adequate in ensuring vaginal control compared to EBRT.

The positive results must be interpreted cautiously due to the heterogeneity of exercise programs tested and measures used to assess HRQoL and HRQoL domains, and the risk of bias in many trials.

The clinical benefit of induction therapy with natalizumab in Crohn's disease should be weighed against the potential risk of serious adverse events. Preliminary data from the retrospective investigation of adverse events associated with natalizumab suggest that it may be possible to identify patients at risk for PML by testing for the appearance of JC virus in plasma.,JB6Z8F,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of natalizumab for the treatment of active Crohn's disease.,8FWF5T,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of natalizumab for the treatment of patients with primary inflammatory bowel disease.

There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether other antiviral treatments prevent PHN. Additional well-designed, randomised controlled trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents, with a greater number of participants are needed.

In the combined regimen, the dose of mifepristone can be lowered to 200 mg without significantly decreasing the method effectiveness. Vaginal misoprostol is more effective than oral administration, and has less side effects than sublingual or buccal. Some results are limited by the small numbers of participants on which they are based. Almost all trials were conducted in settings with good access to emergency services, which may limit the generalizability of these results.",AQ85CE,The use of mifepristone in combination with gemeprost is effective in inducing immediate and selective abortion.

There is some evidence of benefit in children being treated for marasmus (severe malnutrition) but this is based on one small trial and should therefore be treated with caution.,PX7SGV,There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of zinc supplementation in children. Further trials are needed.,AQ85CE,Zinc supplementation in children with persistent diarrhoea significantly reduces the risk of death and morbidity from diarrhoeas.

The titration (low dose) regimen had fewer adverse effects than the block-replace (high dose) regimen and was no less effective.

CD008591,"Evidence for the effectiveness of SGAs is limited to one small trial of fluoxetine compared with placebo, which shows a non-significant effect in favour of fluoxetine, and two small trials comparing fluoxetine against light therapy, which suggest equivalence between the two interventions. The lack of available evidence precludes the ability to draw any overall conclusions on the use of SGAs for SAD. Further larger RCTs are required to expand and strengthen the evidence base on this topic, and should also include comparisons with psychotherapy and other SGAs.
Data on adverse events were sparse, and a comparative analysis was not possible. Therefore the data we obtained on adverse effects is not robust and our confidence in the data is limited. Overall, up to 27% of participants treated with SGAs for SAD withdrew from the studies early due to adverse effects. The overall quality of evidence in this review is very low.",SPNXTA,"Duloxetine, reboxetin, and escitalopram were equally effective in the treatment of SAD.

CD004888,Peginterferon plus ribavirin may be considered a treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C and stable HIV who have not received treatment for hepatitis C as the intervention may clear the blood of HCV RNA. Supporting evidence comes mainly from the analysis of this non-validated surrogate outcome assessed in comparisons against other antiviral treatments. There is no evidence on treatment of patients who have relapsed or did not respond to previous therapy.

CD003412,"Overall there has been very little good quality research on treatments for BCC. Most trials have only evaluated BCCs in low risk locations. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments with surgery showing the lowest failure rates.

CD003654,"Diuretics are preferred first-line over CCBs to optimize reduction of cardiovascular events. The review does not distinguish between CCBs, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, but does provide evidence supporting the use of CCBs over β-blockers. Many of the differences found in the current review are not robust and further trials might change the conclusions.

CD005514,"There is not sufficient evidence to state that the occlusal splint is effective for treating sleep bruxism. Indication of its use is questionable with regard to sleep outcomes, but it may be that there is some benefit with regard to tooth wear. This systematic review suggests the need for further investigation in more controlled RCTs that pay attention to method of allocation, outcome assessment, large sample size, and sufficient duration of follow up.

CD000123,"Lipid-lowering therapy is effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in people with PAD. It may also improve local symptoms. Until further evidence on the relative effectiveness of different lipid-lowering agents is available, use of a statin in people with PAD and a blood cholesterol level ≥ 3.5 mmol/litre is most indicated.",VNCH8M,"Glycosaminoglycan s may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to severe atherosclerosis.

CD006726,"There is evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for treating PTSD in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. At this stage, there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of one psychological therapy compared to others. There is also not enough evidence to conclude that children and adolescents with particular types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to psychological therapies than others.
The findings of this review are limited by the potential for methodological biases, and the small number and generally small size of identified studies. In addition, there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity in some analyses which could not be explained by subgroup or sensitivity analyses.
More evidence is required for the effectiveness of all psychological therapies more than one month after treatment. Much more evidence is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies or the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared to other treatments. More details are required in future trials in regards to the types of trauma that preceded the diagnosis of PTSD and whether the traumas are single event or ongoing. Future studies should also aim to identify the most valid and reliable measures of PTSD symptoms and ensure that all scores, total and sub-scores, are consistently reported.",SPNXTA,"There is some evidence to support the use of psychological interventions for children and adolescents with PTSD. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support their continued use.",AQ85CE,"There is some evidence that psychological therapies are effective in treating children with post traumatic stress disorder. However, the evidence is limited and the quality of the evidence was poor. There is a need for more research to evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies in children with PTSD."
CD004481,"We did not find evidence either to support or refute the use of colchicine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. As we are not able to exclude a detrimental effect of colchicine, we suggest that it is only used in randomised clinical trials.",8FWF5T,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of colchicine in the treatment of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of colchicine in the treatment of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.,SPNXTA,Colchicine alone or in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid does not significantly improve liver-related mortality or mortality in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.
CD006829,"Concerns over the analysis and availability of data from the studies bring into question the superiority of ICS/LABA over LABA alone in preventing exacerbations. The effects on hospitalisations were inconsistent and require further exploration. There was moderate quality evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with ICS/LABA. There was moderate quality evidence that treatments had similar effects on mortality. Quality of life, symptoms score, rescue medication use and FEV1 improved more on ICS/LABA than on LABA, but the average differences were probably not clinically significant for these outcomes. To an individual patient the increased risk of pneumonia needs to be balanced against the possible reduction in exacerbations.

CD003654,"Diuretics are preferred first-line over CCBs to optimize reduction of cardiovascular events. The review does not distinguish between CCBs, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, but does provide evidence supporting the use of CCBs over β-blockers. Many of the differences found in the current review are not robust and further trials might change the conclusions. More well-designed RCTs studying the mortality and morbidity of patients taking CCBs as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension, different ages, and with different co-morbidities such as diabetes.",PX7SGV,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of patients with hypertension.,AQ85CE,There is no evidence to support the use of ACEi in the prevention of CKD in people with hypertension.

The is no evidence that electronic reporting is more effective than paper-based reporting.,AQ85CE,"The evidence from this review suggests that the use of a consistent and consistent reporting mechanism for medication errors is effective in reducing the number of reports per week and increasing the quality of reports. The evidence from the review suggests a similar effect for other outcomes, such as hospital readmission rates, patient satisfaction, and hospital readmissions. However, the evidence is limited and the quality and quantity of the evidence was variable. The review did not provide a good estimate of the effect of the use and type of reporting system."
CD005137,In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. Despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. Partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. Treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.,JB6Z8F,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either full or partial patching for the treatment of amblyopia. Further trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment for amblyopia.,8FWF5T,pharmacologic interventions for amblyopia are effective in improving visual acuity and improving contrast sensitivity.

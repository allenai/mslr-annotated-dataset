Additional benefits of improved muscular strength and LBM identify high-intensity resistance training as a feasible and effective component in the management program for older patients with type 2 diabetes. These beneficial effects in reflectory autonomic regulation and glucose control caused by exercise may be associated with improved prognosis of type 2 diabetes patients. CT is an effective method of training that improved functional capacity, lean body mass, strength and glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The improved insulin sensitivity is related to loss of abdominal subcutaneous and visceral AT and to increased muscle density. These data indicate that a low-to-moderate level of aerobic training, independent of dietary changes, is an effective and feasible method of improving cardiovascular risk factors: physical fitness, systolic blood pressure, plasma triglycerides, and glycemic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. Physical training resulted in an improvement in insulin sensitivity with concomitant loss of VAT and should be included in the treatment program for patients with NIDDM. Increased insulin response is at least one main mechanism of the action of exercise. The improvement in metabolic control persisted significantly in patients who continued to exercise at varying levels at home during 1 year of follow-up. These results suggest that RT is an effective form of exercise training which modestly improves glycaemic control and lowers fasting insulin levels in obese type 2 diabetics.

Placebo response rates were high, suggesting that a considerable portion of the therapeutic response is determined by patient expectations, ongoing symptom monitoring, attention, and other nonspecific factors. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. Because exercise was associated with a modest improvement in depressive symptoms at 10 weeks, older people with poorly responsive depressive disorder should be encouraged to attend group exercise activities. Overall, the results of the study suggest that energy-regulating systems are implicated in the antidepressant action of the non-drug treatments. These results indicate that, at least in the short term, exercise has a broader effect compared with control conditions in reducing depressive symptoms in the moderately depressed elderly. However, exercise has the added benefit of improving physical functioning as well. Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. In neither trial was there any correlation between the extent of change in the subjects' physical fitness due to aerobic exercise and the extent of the improvement of psychiatric scores. (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. More research is needed to clarify the relative benefits of different types of exercise in conjunction with or without pharmacological intervention. Randomized placebo controlled trials are needed to confirm the results. The findings of this study suggest that a group jogging exercise may be effective in improving depressive state, hormonal response to stress and physiological fitness of adolescent females with depressive symptoms. These results provide the first controlled evidence concerning the effects of strenuous exercise on depression. Although antidepressants may facilitate a more rapid initial therapeutic response than exercise, after 16 weeks of treatment exercise was equally effective in reducing depression among patients with MDD. PRT is an effective antidepressant in depressed elders, while also improving strength, morale, and quality of life.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8892800808,"bertscore_r":0.8723658323,"bertscore_f":0.880741775,"rouge1_p":0.2820512821,"rouge1_r":0.2444444444,"rouge1_f":0.2619047619,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.1538461538,"rougeL_r":0.1333333333,"rougeL_f":0.1428571429,"rougeLsum_p":0.1538461538,"rougeLsum_r":0.1333333333,"rougeLsum_f":0.1428571429,"ei_score":0.8333715272,"claimver":0.8058470488,"sts":0.8088573217,"nli":0.8698351383},"entities":[["group jogging exercise","INT"],["exercise","INT"],["placebo","INT"],["depressive state, hormonal response to stress and physiological fitness","OUT"],["psychiatric scores","OUT"],["functioning","OUT"],["older people with poorly responsive depressive disorder","PAR"],["prt","INT"],["patients with mdd","PAR"],["adolescent females with depressive symptoms","PAR"],["strength, morale, and quality of life","OUT"],["group exercise","INT"],["patients with major depression","PAR"],["response rates","OUT"],["physical fitness","OUT"],["endurance exercise","INT"],["depressive symptoms","OUT"],["depressed elders","PAR"],["moderately depressed elderly","PAR"],["strenuous exercise","INT"],["depression","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of exercise as a treatment for depression.

The safety of propranolol and its lack of serious side effects were demonstrated. In conclusion, non-selective beta-blockade (propranolol) significantly increases the platelet aggregability compared to beta 1-selective blockade (metoprolol). Improvement of migraine index was not related to different plasma levels of the two drugs. Both active treatments were well tolerated. It can therefore be concluded that cyclandelate as well as propranolol are two comparable substances in the prophylactic treatment of migraine, with cyclandelate showing fewer side effects. In individuals using flunarizine (alone or associated with propranolol) the therapeutic effect was largely maintained up to 45 days after drug withdrawal. In three patients the frequency actually increased over the placebo effect. The number of sickleave days and the use of symptomatic drugs were both less on propranolol treatment than on clonidine, but there was no statistically conclusive difference. No significant difference was identified between divalproex and propranolol for the prophylaxis of migraine without aura. In addition, no significant differences between the three treatments were found with regard to safety: all three treatments were generally well-tolerated and safe. Two and 4 months after treatment withdrawal, most subjects with a negative response to the post-treatment test maintained treatment benefit, whereas benefit was lost in patients with an early onset migraine response. All three groups reported improvement, the most noticeable being in those patients who received 80 mg of nadolol daily. The low incidence of generally mild side-effects with flunarizine may make it preferable to many of the agents at present in use for migraine prophylaxis. Nevertheless, due to the infrequent subjective side effects associated with femoxetine treatment it may be a valuable prophylactic drug to a subgroup of migraine patients. Although propranolol, which is considered a reference for the interval treatment of migraine, is more effective, 5-hydroxytryptophan is a possible alternative for many patients. It is concluded that timolol and propranolol are equally effective in the used doses (1:8) for common migraine prophylaxis. Flunarizine is at least as effective as propranolol in the prophylactic treatment of migraine and may have a better safety profile. In both groups no severe side effects were observed. Summarizing, it may be stated that the studies proved the efficacy of flunarizine to be rather similar to that of propranolol in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. None of the observed side effects led to a withdrawal from treatment. Beta blockers thus appear to have a significant effect on the increased excitability of the visual system in patients with migraine, although their action is not directly related to their reduction of migraine frequency. The results indicate that beta-receptor blocking properties, but possibly also properties other than the beta-blocking ones, may be of importance for the anti-migraine effect of propranolol. The biochemical tests and the type of psychological profile cannot be used to predict drug response. No significant change was found in the hormones levels during nimodipine treatment. The study suggests that mefenamic acid and propranolol are equally effective for migraine prophylaxis. The results and methodological assumptions of the double blind studies with cross over already under consideration in the literature are discussed. Side effects were the cause of premature discontinuation of study medicine in 9 patients during propranolol treatment (dizziness, fatigue, and fall in blood pressure) and in 5 patients during tolfenamic acid treatment (gastrointestinal symptoms). We conclude that nifedipine is not an agent of first choice for the prophylaxis of migraine. The effectiveness of neither drug correlated with a decrease in anxiety or depression demonstrated by psychological testing. Discussion concerns the effects of the chronically given 5-HT agonists and antagonists as well as the possible receptor mechanism underlying craving for serotonin\" in severe M. The increase of 5-HT supersensitivity evidenced at the end of M attacks is also discussed and its role in determining the interruption of the attack is here suggested. It was concluded that the prophylactic effect of tolfenamic acid 300 mg\/day in migraine was at least as good as propranolol 120 mg\/day. The study showed that partial depletion of thrombocyte 5-HT uptake inhibitor did not lead to a marked improvement in headache","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8708356619,"bertscore_r":0.8670066595,"bertscore_f":0.8689169288,"rouge1_p":0.4074074074,"rouge1_r":0.2156862745,"rouge1_f":0.2820512821,"rouge2_p":0.1153846154,"rouge2_r":0.06,"rouge2_f":0.0789473684,"rougeL_p":0.2592592593,"rougeL_r":0.137254902,"rougeL_f":0.1794871795,"rougeLsum_p":0.2592592593,"rougeLsum_r":0.137254902,"rougeLsum_f":0.1794871795,"ei_score":0.429475195,"claimver":0.7341817617,"sts":0.7279574275,"nli":0.8073937297},"entities":[["nimodipine","INT"],["metoprolol )","INT"],["5 - ht supersensitivity","OUT"],["beta","INT"],["divalproex propranolol","INT"],["placebo","INT"],["nadolol","INT"],["migraine without aura","OUT"],["headache","OUT"],["propranolol clonidine","INT"],["side effects","OUT"],["number of sickleave days and the use of symptomatic drugs","OUT"],["migraine frequency","OUT"],["timolol propranolol","INT"],["well tolerated reported side - effects","OUT"],["frequency","OUT"],["excitability","OUT"],["improvement","OUT"],["prophylactic effect","OUT"],["treatment benefit","OUT"],["hormones levels","OUT"],["severe side effects","OUT"],["platelet aggregability","OUT"],["( dizziness, fatigue, and fall in blood pressure )","OUT"],["cyclandelate propranolol cyclandelate","INT"],["tolfenamic acid propranolol","INT"],["safety : well - tolerated safe","OUT"],["efficacy","OUT"],["tolfenamic acid","INT"],["ht","INT"],["flunarizine propranolol","INT"],["nifedipine","INT"],["propranolol","INT"],["propranolol 5 - hydroxytryptophan","INT"],["flunarizine","INT"],["gastrointestinal symptoms )","OUT"],["serious side effects","OUT"],["well tolerated","OUT"],["femoxetine","INT"],["patients with migraine","PAR"],["therapeutic effect","OUT"],["anxiety or depression","OUT"],["migraine index levels","OUT"],["safety","OUT"],["mefenamic acid propranolol","INT"],["migraine patients","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is no evidence that beta blockers are more effective than placebo in the prophylaxis of migraine attacks.

PCS with propofol is effective and results in high patient satisfaction and faster discharge. PCS provides an acceptable alternative to sedation with midazolam and pethidine with the advantage of significantly faster recovery times, which are of relevance in the outpatient setting. For outpatient colonoscopy, propofol administered by nurses and supervised by endoscopists has several advantages over midazolam plus meperidine and deserves additional investigation. Nurse-administered propofol resulted in several advantages for outpatient colonoscopy compared with midazolam plus fentanyl, but did not improve patient satisfaction. Our data suggest that the synergistic sedation with a low dose of midazolam combined with propofol was superior to a standard combination of midazolam and the opioid pethidine for colonoscopies as far as the patient comfort and recovery times are concerned. Patient-controlled sedation is an effective alternative to premedication with narcotic\/benzodiazepine combinations during colonoscopy. The use's safety and the fast recovery with propofol incite to advocate it as an unique+ anaesthetic agent for colonoscopies. Remifentanil provided a smoother haemodynamic profile than propofol; however, the frequent occurrence of remifentanil-induced hypoventilation requires the cautious administration of this agent. Despite higher costs, nurse-administered propofol-alfentanil sedation using a PCA pump can provide deeper conscious sedation, comparable satisfaction, and similar complication risks compared with conventional opioid-benzodiazepine sedation. However, remifentanil-induced nausea and vomiting may be a problem during the recovery phase. It is associated with a high degree of patient comfort and rapid recovery times, and has a potential cost benefit concerning nursing care and bed facilities.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8894720078,"bertscore_r":0.8395122886,"bertscore_f":0.8637703061,"rouge1_p":0.4516129032,"rouge1_r":0.2089552239,"rouge1_f":0.2857142857,"rouge2_p":0.0333333333,"rouge2_r":0.0151515152,"rouge2_f":0.0208333333,"rougeL_p":0.1935483871,"rougeL_r":0.0895522388,"rougeL_f":0.1224489796,"rougeLsum_p":0.1935483871,"rougeLsum_r":0.0895522388,"rougeLsum_f":0.1224489796,"ei_score":0.1360690443,"claimver":0.5748389363,"sts":0.6965950727,"nli":0.7776901722},"entities":[["patient satisfaction","OUT"],["propofol - alfentanil sedation","INT"],["propofol midazolam plus meperidine","INT"],["propofol and alfentanil midazolam meperidine","INT"],["nausea and vomiting","OUT"],["propofol midazolam plus fentanyl","INT"],["pcs propofol","INT"],["hypoventilation","OUT"],["midazolam pethidine","INT"],["midazolam combined with propofol midazolam pethidine","INT"],["propofol","INT"],["haemodynamic profile","OUT"],["patient - sedation","INT"],["benzodiazepine","INT"],["satisfaction","OUT"],["conscious sedation satisfaction complication risks","OUT"],["remifentanil","INT"],["patient satisfaction recovery","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of sedation for colonoscopy.

The use of antiparkinson drugs completely controlled the extrapyramidal symptoms. Aripiprazole, effective against positive and negative symptoms, is a safe and well-tolerated potential treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

It is a selective cytoprotectant without reducing the effect of chemotherapy. By protecting against cumulative doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity, ICRF-187 permits significantly greater doses of doxorubicin to be administered to patients with greater safety. DZR is the first agent shown to reduce cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin. Additional clinical trials with larger numbers of patients are needed to determine if the short-term cardioprotection afforded by ICRF-187 will reduce the incidence of late cardiac complications in long-term survivors of childhood cancer. The clinical use of dexrazoxane should be recommended in patients whose risk of developing cardiotoxicity could hamper the eventual use and possible benefit of epirubicin. Prophylactic use of carvedilol in patients receiving ANT may protect both systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricle. These data demonstrate a protective effect of CoQ on cardiac function during therapy with ANT. ABVE-PC is a dose-dense regimen that provides outstanding event-free survival\/overall survival with short duration, early-response-adapted therapy. Although RIS is a sensitive technique in detecting anthracycline cardiac damage, its specificity is low and it cannot be considered a primary test for guiding anthracycline treatment. Biochemical and molecular analyses indicated a stimulation of oxidative metabolism in white blood cells through carnitine uptake. These findings suggest that simultaneous administration of PNL may mitigate ADM cardiotoxicity, but larger trials are needed to draw definite conclusions. Dexrazoxane significantly reduced the occurrence and severity of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction due to previous anthracycline treatment without compromising the antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic regimen. The preliminary results, however, suggest efficient cardioprotection by this cheap and safe antioxidant combination, so that larger studies are warranted for confirmation. Therefore, dexrazoxane can reduce the arrhythmic risk in patients treated with epirubicin.

Clinical trial registered with www.controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN11597444). Copyright 2008 Massachusetts Medical Society. Norepinephrine, however, may have a more favorable hemodynamic profile and improve splanchnic tissue oxygen utilization in sepsis. This effect was probably a result of higher cardiac index. VP is a useful agent in the treatment of refractory septic shock. However, terlipressin was more rapidly effective for maintaining normal systolic arterial blood pressure during general anesthesia. Supplementary AVP infusion in patients with advanced vasodilatory shock and severe postoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome did not compromise cutaneous reactive hyperaemia and flowmotion when compared with norepinephrine infusion alone. There is no evidence for a difference in efficacy and safety between epinephrine alone and norepinephrine plus dobutamine for the management of septic shock. Although no adverse events were noticed in the present study, potential benefits of increasing Svo2 after terlipressin bolus infusion need to be weighted against the risk of cardiovascular complications resulting from high-dose dobutamine. At the same time, oxygen uptake was increased. 2010 Massachusetts Medical Society The increased oxygen demand in the splanchnic region is the main risk factor for splanchnic tissue hypoxia in septic shock. Despite the development of potential drug-related effects with epinephrine, there was no difference in the achievement of a MAP goal between epinephrine and norepinephrine in a heterogenous population of ICU patients. The combined infusion of AVP and NE proved to be superior to infusion of NE alone in the treatment of cardiocirculatory failure in catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock. Patients receiving DA should be monitored for the development of cardiac arrhythmias (NCT00604019). The metabolic and splanchnic effects of the combination of norepinephrine and dobutamine in hyperdynamic dopamine-resistant septic shock appeared to be more predictable and more appropriate to the current goals of septic shock therapy than those of epinephrine alone. AVP decreases NE exposure, has no effect on the PrCO(2) - PaCO(2 )difference, and improves renal function and SOFA score. Terlipressin seems to cause no adverse effect but warrants further evaluation as a rescue therapy in refractory septic shock. The present study provides evidence that continuous infusion of low-dose terlipressin--when given as first-line vasopressor agent in septic shock--is effective in reversing sepsis-induced arterial hypotension and in reducing norepinephrine requirements.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8917167187,"bertscore_r":0.8562119007,"bertscore_f":0.8736037612,"rouge1_p":0.5454545455,"rouge1_r":0.1621621622,"rouge1_f":0.25,"rouge2_p":0.1428571429,"rouge2_r":0.0410958904,"rouge2_f":0.0638297872,"rougeL_p":0.4545454545,"rougeL_r":0.1351351351,"rougeL_f":0.2083333333,"rougeLsum_p":0.4545454545,"rougeLsum_r":0.1351351351,"rougeLsum_f":0.2083333333,"ei_score":0.0042140563,"claimver":0.6565026045,"sts":0.8059584498,"nli":0.8139287233},"entities":[["oxygen uptake","OUT"],["systolic arterial blood pressure","OUT"],["avp ne ne","INT"],["epinephrine alone norepinephrine plus dobutamine","INT"],["metabolic splanchnic","OUT"],["terlipressin","INT"],["vp","INT"],["cutaneous reactive hyperaemia and flowmotion","OUT"],["norepinephrine and dobutamine epinephrine","INT"],["epinephrine norepinephrine","INT"],["terlipressin dobutamine","INT"],["patients with advanced vasodilatory shock and severe postoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","PAR"],["cardiac index","OUT"],["svo2","OUT"],["icu patients","PAR"],["efficacy safety","OUT"],["map goal","OUT"],["sepsis arterial hypotension norepinephrine requirements","OUT"],["avp","INT"],["splanchnic tissue oxygen utilization","OUT"],["norepinephrine","INT"],["ne exposure prco ( 2 ) - paco ( 2 ) difference renal function and sofa score","OUT"],["epinephrine","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of terlipressin in the treatment of hyperdynamic septic shock.

The addition of sulfasalazine, however, offered no advantage. In patients with active Crohn's disease affecting the ileum, the ascending colon, or both, a controlled-ileal-release formulation of budesonide was more effective in inducing remission than a slow-release formulation of mesalamine. The response of active Crohn's disease to sulphasalazine was significantly better than to placebo. 5-Aminosalicylic acid can thus be considered a valuable alternative to conventional treatment on the basis of equal effectiveness as salazosulfapyridine and lack of undesirable side effects. The use of prednisone in addition to sulphasalazine in patients with active Crohn disease results in a significantly faster initial improvement, but not in a significantly better result after 16 weeks of treatment, when disease activity is measured by the Van Hees Activity Index. The meta-analysis of 3 large, double-blind, randomized studies in the treatment of active Crohn's disease confirms that Pentasa 4 g\/day is superior to placebo in reducing the CDAI but the clinical significance of the magnitude of this difference is not clear. Nevertheless, trends towards a beneficial effect in Crohn's disease in the small bowel justify further clinical trials with a larger dosage of 5-ASA. No serious adverse reactions occurred. Although the number of patients in this study was relatively small, Asacol 3.2 g\/day appears to be safe and effective treatment for mildly to moderately active Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis as compared with placebo, and this regimen is an option for treatment of patients who fail or are intolerant of sulfasalazine. This controlled-release mesalamine preparation is safe and effective at 4 g\/day as a single agent in treatment of active Crohn's disease of the ileum and colon. Mesalamine in microgranular formulation seems to be equally as effective as a standard dosage of steroids in the treatment of the mild to moderate form of Crohn's ileitis. These results suggest that this slow-release preparation of 5-ASA should be tested in larger controlled therapeutic trials over a longer period of time. There is less than a 5% risk that a clinically significant prophylactic effect of any of the drug regimens was missed. However, the potential benefit of a higher dose cannot be excluded.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8935292363,"bertscore_r":0.8471054435,"bertscore_f":0.8696982861,"rouge1_p":0.4791666667,"rouge1_r":0.2395833333,"rouge1_f":0.3194444444,"rouge2_p":0.1489361702,"rouge2_r":0.0736842105,"rouge2_f":0.0985915493,"rougeL_p":0.3333333333,"rougeL_r":0.1666666667,"rougeL_f":0.2222222222,"rougeLsum_p":0.3333333333,"rougeLsum_r":0.1666666667,"rougeLsum_f":0.2222222222,"ei_score":0.8520893756,"claimver":0.8362127542,"sts":0.6963603497,"nli":0.7354946136},"entities":[["5 - asa","INT"],["serious adverse reactions","OUT"],["patients with active crohn disease","PAR"],["##es activity","OUT"],["remission","OUT"],["patients who fail or are intolerant of","PAR"],["5 - aminosalicylic acid salazosulfapyridine","INT"],["prednisone sulphasalazine","INT"],["5 asa","INT"],["response of active crohn's disease","OUT"],["budesonide","INT"],["patients with active crohn's disease affecting the ileum, the ascending colon, or both","PAR"],["active crohn's disease","PAR"],["sulfasalazine","INT"],["mesalamine","INT"],["pentasa placebo","INT"],["mesalamine steroids","INT"],["sulphasalazine placebo","INT"],["asacol placebo","INT"],["patients with activer cd who are intolerant to or refuse","PAR"],["cdai","OUT"],["safe effective","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of 5-aminosalicylic acid in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis.

It is concluded that combination treatment regimens utilising interferons together with chemotherapeutic agents deserve further study in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma. Of the three regimens tested, the combination of temozolomide and thalidomide seems the most promising for future study. Temozolomide demonstrates efficacy equal to that of DTIC and is an oral alternative for patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, our treatment schedule was carried out on outpatients and had an acceptable level of toxicity. More toxicity was encountered in the combination arm, which was acceptable except in three patients where treatment was discontinued because of IFN toxicity. The use of combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens is not recommended in the absence of well-designed, prospective, randomized protocols showing the benefit of this treatment strategy. Copyright 2002 The Cancer Research Campaign A meta-analysis is required to determine whether there is a role for the addition of IFN-alpha to DTIC in the treatment of this disease. The addition of subcutaneous IL-2 and IFNalpha to BCDT chemotherapy in a randomized phase II trial resulted in immune activation but did not improve response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma, and indeed may increase some treatment-related toxicity.

Addition of a 10 min infusion of salbutamol in the early treatment of children with acute severe asthma has the potential to curtail the clinical progression of asthma, reduce demand placed on hospital resources, and improve the quality of health care provided to the acutely sick child with asthma. In view of the risks of intravenous treatment, especially using high doses, inhaled bronchodilator therapy would seem advisable as initial treatment. We conclude that both the intravenous and inhalational administration of terbutaline are effective in acute severe asthma, but that the intravenous route is possibly better for increasing PaO2. Hydrocortisone was given after 2 hours, but did not appear to affect the rate of recovery. We conclude that, in hypercapnic acute asthma, the nebulized route has a greater efficacy and fewer side effects than the intravenous route.

Budesonide\/formoterol in a single inhaler (Symbicort) maintains the benefit of treatment optimisation, stabilising lung function and delaying exacerbations more effectively than either component drug alone or placebo. Both budesonide\/formoterol pMDI dosages were well tolerated relative to formoterol and placebo. We conclude that FSC 250\/50 decreases lung hyperinflation at rest and during exercise with an associated increase in exercise endurance time when compared with placebo. Because inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists and corticosteroid combination treatment produces better control of symptoms and lung function, with no greater risk of side-effects than that with use of either component alone, this combination treatment should be considered for patients with COPD. Both budesonide\/formoterol pMDI dosage strengths were well tolerated relative to the monocomponents and placebo. We conclude that FSC improved lung function and reduced the severity of dyspnea compared with individual components and placebo. Treatment with FSC (FP, 250 microg, and SM, 50 microg) twice daily substantially improved morning lung function and sustained these improvements for over a period of 24 weeks compared with FP or SM treatment alone in patients with COPD, with no additional safety concerns for the combination treatment vs that with the individual components. SM&FP 50\/250 microcg regularly assumed in combination via a single Diskus inhaler for a 52 week period improves respiratory function (such as FEV(1), morning PEF), and and symptom score significantly in moderate COPD previously treated with theophylline, and at an higher extent than SM alone or P. The use of beta(2) short acting prn is also reduced, together with the number of exacerbations. This study demonstrates that combination therapy with salmeterol\/fluticasone compared with salmeterol monotherapy significantly reduces the frequency of moderate\/severe exacerbations in patients with severe COPD. These data confirm the beneficial effect of FSC on the management of COPD exacerbations and support the use of FSC in patients with COPD.

In addition, for most spatial parameters, the statistical significance varied considerably among the three methods used for the analysis of symmetry. Application of these results to the choice of prosthetic components is discussed. These results suggest that the intact lower extremity is susceptible to excessive floor impact, and that prosthetic foot design can have an effect on the magnitude of the vertical forces experienced by the limb. The Re-Flex VSP appears to have a positive effect on energy cost, efficiency, and relative exercise intensity compared with the other prosthetic foot types during walking and running. To improve the walking abilities of those persons with transtibial amputations, prosthetic foot designs need to incorporate mechanisms which promote early foot flat while preserving limb stability. Based on this pilot data, recommendations are made for future studies including appropriate sample size. These results seem to support the classification criteria of articulated and non-articulated prosthetic mechanisms. This increased rate was a function of the greater walking velocity employed by the traumatic subjects, made possible by their better physical fitness. During walking at comfortable speed with the Multiflex foot the ankle and hip range of motion averaged 2.1 and 3.1 degrees respectively, less than during walking with the Quantum foot. Results provide quantitative and qualitative information about the dynamic performance of the various feet, which can be helpful in prescribing the optimal prosthetic foot for individual amputees. The energy-storing foot should be reserved for active and fast walkers, whereas the SACH foot seems more suitable for elderly patients with amputation with a slow walk. The effective factor of the Flex-foot appears to be minimization of the center of gravity elevation, which was accomplished through a significant increase in terminal stance dorsiflexion compared to the other feet tested (p < .0001). Further studies with a larger sample size are suggested. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd. Because no energy savings resulted for the DER feet, the release of stored energy in the flexible feet may not occur at the proper time to assist in ambulation as a result of the natural frequency of oscillation. Via accelerometer measurement, it was found that the more compliant and lossy SACH foot heel was less likely to transmit high frequency vibration. Future prosthetic designs should provide TT amputees with improved ankle mobility that attempt to capture the dynamic characteristics of a normal articulation between the foot and shank segments during the early stance weight acceptance period. All investigated variations can be clearly characterized by the sagittal moments acting on the joints of the prosthetic limb during gait.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9004775882,"bertscore_r":0.847029686,"bertscore_f":0.8729362488,"rouge1_p":0.4864864865,"rouge1_r":0.1666666667,"rouge1_f":0.2482758621,"rouge2_p":0.1666666667,"rouge2_r":0.0560747664,"rouge2_f":0.0839160839,"rougeL_p":0.4324324324,"rougeL_r":0.1481481481,"rougeL_f":0.2206896552,"rougeLsum_p":0.4324324324,"rougeLsum_r":0.1481481481,"rougeLsum_f":0.2206896552,"ei_score":0.0188791134,"claimver":0.6379231215,"sts":0.6355338097,"nli":0.747906208},"entities":[["amputees","PAR"],["ankle and hip range of motion","OUT"],["persons with transtibial amputations","PAR"],["center of gravity elevation terminal stance dorsiflexion","OUT"],["re - flex vsp","INT"],["##ees","PAR"],["energy cost, efficiency, and relative exercise intensity","OUT"],["elderly patients with amputation with a slow","PAR"],["walking velocity","OUT"],["high frequency vibration","OUT"],["walking","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of transtibial prostheses for the treatment of below-knee amputations.

These results were obtained on older patients with mild to moderate cognitive and behavioural impairment of various clinical origins, including chronic cerebrovascular disorders and Alzheimer's dementia. The few studies specifically performed on patients with Alzheimer's disease were performed with too few people to give a definitive answer to the questions concerning the use of nicergoline for this form of dementia.This drug has not been evaluated using current diagnostic categories such as MCI or in association with therapeutic agents of different nature such as cholinesterase or antioxidant drugs.","predictions":[{"exp_short":"SPNXTA","prediction":"Nicergoline appears to be beneficial in the treatment of mild to moderate dementia.

Manual removal of the placenta at cesarean delivery results in more operative blood loss and a higher incidence of postcesarean endometritis. Routine manual removal of placenta at cesarean section significantly increases perioperative blood loss and postpartum maternal infectious morbidity. There were no statistically significant differences in measures of postcesarean febrile morbidity based on placental delivery method or intraoperative glove change. Manual delivery of the placenta is not associated with a significantly greater risk of operative blood loss, decreased postoperative hemoglobin levels or increased incidence of endometritis compared with spontaneous placental separation. We conclude that spontaneous expulsion of the placenta at cesarean delivery results in less operative blood loss and a lower incidence of postoperative endometritis. The frequency of febrile morbidity in our study cases was considerably lower than heretofore reported. Spontaneous delivery of the placenta after cesarean delivery is associated with a decrease in the incidence of postcesarean infections. Intraoperative glove change does not decrease post-cesarean endometritis.

Further randomised data is needed to ascertain whether this information translates into improvement in limb survival.","predictions":[{"exp_short":"SPNXTA","prediction":"PTFE is superior to PTFE for bypass grafting above the knee, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether it is superior in terms of mortality, rest, rest and tissue loss.","annotations":[{"annot_id":0,"annot_task":"main","fluency":1,"population":2,"intervention":1,"outcome":0,"ed_target":2,"ed_generated":null,"strength_target":3,"strength_generated":0,"ed_agree":false,"strength_agree":false},{"annot_id":1,"annot_task":"main","fluency":0,"population":1,"intervention":1,"outcome":0,"ed_target":2,"ed_generated":null,"strength_target":2,"strength_generated":null,"ed_agree":false,"strength_agree":false}],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8838434815,"bertscore_r":0.8486816287,"bertscore_f":0.8659057617,"rouge1_p":0.3333333333,"rouge1_r":0.1290322581,"rouge1_f":0.1860465116,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.2083333333,"rougeL_r":0.0806451613,"rougeL_f":0.1162790698,"rougeLsum_p":0.2083333333,"rougeLsum_r":0.0806451613,"rougeLsum_f":0.1162790698,"ei_score":0.0271562972,"claimver":0.559812963,"sts":0.4626683593,"nli":0.548525393},"entities":[["ptfe ptfe","INT"],["mortality, rest, rest and tissue loss","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"6GBRY0","prediction":"Corresponding rates for secondary patency at 6 years were 51.4% and 76.4% (p < 0.005). Dacron is the graft material of choice if the saphenous vein is not available. There was no difference in long-term graft performance between HUV and HBD for above knee infrainguinal bypass. During follow-up the incidence of PTFE failure was on the average 2.1 times higher than that of umbilical vein failure (95% confidence limits 1.2 to 3.4). The use of polytetrafluoroethylene above the knee is a reasonable alternative in femoropopliteal bypass grafting that is associated with acceptable short-term patency rates. PTFE and Dacron are equally suitable for femoro-popliteal bypass. Use of SV, however, leads to fewer occlusions and repeat operations. This trial confirms that Dacron is at least as durable as PTFE for above-knee bypass procedures, and might even be superior. The incidence of major limb amputation, however, was significantly greater (P < .025) in the PTFE group compared with the HBD group at both 3 and 5 years of follow-up. The use of collagen impregnated woven polyester prosthesis above the knee is a reasonable alternative in femoropopliteal bypass grafting that is associated with acceptable short-term patency rates.

No significant difference could be seen in the tubed or no-tube group. The authors conclude that routine nasogastric decompression is not warranted after elective surgery involving small- or large-bowel anastomosis. Routine nasogastric decompression is not necessary in elective operations for gastric cancer. The surgical dogma of the need to have an NGT in longer for blunt trauma was not revealed in this study, however, a larger study would be needed to determine this with significance. We conclude that such a routine is not justified and should be reserved for those patients developing specific complications. Therefore, it is more beneficial to the recovery of patients without undergoing gastrointestinal decompression. We conclude that in elective colon operations, the routine use of postoperative nasogastric decompression is unnecessary and can safely be omitted. Cimetidine lowered nasogastric output on the first postoperative day (p less than 0.05), but did not prevent vomiting. Early feeding is feasible and well tolerated and is associated with reduced postoperative discomfort and a more rapid recovery in patients undergoing major surgery for gynecologic malignancies. We conclude that even though there is an increase in the rate of minor symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention, routine nasgastric decompression is not warranted after elective colon and rectal surgery. These strategies of early removing gastrointestinal decompression and early oral feeding in the patients undergoing colorectostomy are feasible and safe and associated with reduced postoperative discomfort and can accelerate the return of bowel function and improve rehabilitation. However, these findings suggest that NGT maintenance increases the risk of respiratory complications and the length of hospital stay. We suggest that NG tubes should be used according to the specific problems of each patient. Tube decompression should be used only in patients with paralytic ileus. (c) 2007 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Routine postoperative nasogastric decompression is unnecessary after radical gastrectomy even in the presence of gastric outlet obstruction. Routine placement of an NJT after Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy is unnecessary in elective total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. In conclusion, the routine postoperative use of nasogastric tubes for abdominal aortic procedures is unnecessary. As a result of this study, we have eliminated postoperative nasogastric decompression except in highly selected circumstances, such as extensive bowel surgery in patients with prior irradiation or substantial edema from bowel obstruction. Routine prophylactic postoperative nasogastric decompression is unnecessary after elective gastrectomy. Routine nasogastric aspiration after gastric or intestinal resection does not confer significant advantages to outweigh its discomfort and potential morbidity for patients and should be replaced by selective intubation when required postoperatively. These data seem to indicate that the routine prophylactic use of a nasogastric tube is unnecessary in gastrointestinal operations. The routine application of NGT in elective abdominal surgery could be omitted if the surgeon and nursing team are willing to renounce a useful tool in providing informations about the resolution of postoperative intestinal atony to the patient's benefit: in fact a severe discomfort due to the NGT was recorded in the 70% of our series. These results suggest that gastric cancer surgery can be performed safely without nasogastric decompression. This study has objectively demonstrated that early oral feeding is feasible and safe in patients who have elective colorectal surgery. Furthermore, we continue to support avoidance of routine prophylactic postoperative nasogastric decompression in uncomplicated, elective abdominal colorectal surgery. These data support selective use of NGD in general surgical patients and routine use of NGD for patients having major retroperitoneal or vascular procedures.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8949831724,"bertscore_r":0.8868000507,"bertscore_f":0.8908728361,"rouge1_p":0.380952381,"rouge1_r":0.32,"rouge1_f":0.347826087,"rouge2_p":0.1,"rouge2_r":0.0833333333,"rouge2_f":0.0909090909,"rougeL_p":0.2380952381,"rougeL_r":0.2,"rougeL_f":0.2173913043,"rougeLsum_p":0.2380952381,"rougeLsum_r":0.2,"rougeLsum_f":0.2173913043,"ei_score":0.3109795352,"claimver":0.7948445082,"sts":0.6482088566,"nli":0.6772327423},"entities":[["cimetidine","INT"],["patients with paralytic ileus","PAR"],["patients who have elective colorectal surgery","PAR"],["nasogastric tubes","INT"],["##t","INT"],["tube decompression","INT"],["patients undergoing colorectostomy","PAR"],["risk of respiratory complications length of hospital stay","OUT"],["symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention","OUT"],["nasogastric output vomiting","OUT"],["oral feeding","INT"],["njt","INT"],["discomfort","OUT"],["patients without undergoing gastrointestinal","PAR"],["nasogastric tube","INT"],["postoperative discomfort","OUT"],["gastric cancer","PAR"],["ngt","INT"],["patients undergoing major surgery for gynecologic malignancies","PAR"],["patients with prior irradiation or substantial edema from bowel obstruction","PAR"],["##ogastric decompression","INT"],["ngd","INT"],["nasogastric aspiration","INT"],["general surgical patients patients having major retroperitoneal or vascular procedures","PAR"],["elective abdominal colorectal surgery","PAR"],["nasogastric decompression","INT"],["discomfort bowel function","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of nasogastric tube decompression in patients undergoing major abdominal operations.

It is concluded that either acupuncture therapy or physiotherapy relieves pain in tension-neck and headache patients. It is recommended that RTB remain the nonmedical treatment of choice for migraine, and that PT may be a useful adjunct for patients who fail to improve after such treatment. This appears to be important to manipulative therapists who appear to practise without the benefit of valid predictors of response to therapy. Manipulation also produced a significant increase in measured rotation that was maintained for three weeks and an immediate improvement in lateral flexion that was not maintained.This is to our knowledge the first published formal trial of such manipulation and should increase interest in this form of treatment by the medical profession. Manipulative therapy and exercise can reduce the symptoms of cervicogenic headache, and the effects are maintained. It appears probable that chiropractic care has an effect on the physical conditions related to stress and that in these people the effects of the migraine are reduced. It should be considered as an alternative to the chronic usage of analgesics. Repeated measure analysis of variance indicated that grouping variables of Biofeedback treatment, symptoms being evidenced less than 2 years and receiving over 15 treatment sessions best predicted successful intervention. As an isolated intervention, spinal manipulation does not seem to have a positive effect on episodic tension-type headache. Study results indicated that TT may have potential beyond a placebo effect in the treatment of tension headache pain. The improvement of headache intensity persisted unchanged 7-12 months after treatment. Spinal manipulation seemed to be as effective as a well-established and efficacious treatment (amitriptyline), and on the basis of a benign side effects profile, it should be considered a treatment option for patients with frequent migraine headaches. Large controlled studies should be performed to determine whether this intervention is actually effective. In conclusion, exposure of the inner thighs to pulsing electromagnetic fields for at least 3 weeks is an effective, short-term intervention for migraine, but not tension headaches. There is a need to assess the effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy beyond four weeks and to compare spinal manipulative therapy to an appropriate placebo such as sham manipulation in future clinical trials. Spinal manipulation has a significant positive effect in cases of cervicogenic headache.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8827123642,"bertscore_r":0.8525868058,"bertscore_f":0.8673881292,"rouge1_p":0.298245614,"rouge1_r":0.2073170732,"rouge1_f":0.2446043165,"rouge2_p":0.0714285714,"rouge2_r":0.049382716,"rouge2_f":0.0583941606,"rougeL_p":0.1929824561,"rougeL_r":0.1341463415,"rougeL_f":0.1582733813,"rougeLsum_p":0.1929824561,"rougeLsum_r":0.1341463415,"rougeLsum_f":0.1582733813,"ei_score":0.2219373288,"claimver":0.5690521002,"sts":0.6596236229,"nli":0.8022551537},"entities":[["pulsing electromagnetic fields","INT"],["spinal manipulation","INT"],["spinal manipulative therapy spinal manipulative therapy sham manipulation","INT"],["acupuncture therapy physiotherapy","INT"],["measured rotation lateral flexion","OUT"],["cervicogenic headache","OUT"],["tension - neck and headache patients","PAR"],["tension - headache","OUT"],["headache intensity","OUT"],["patients with frequent migraine headaches","PAR"],["chiropractic care","INT"],["headache post traumatic dizziness, visual disturbances and ear symptoms","OUT"],["pain","OUT"],["spinal manipulation amitriptyline )","INT"],["manipulative therapy and exercise","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of physical therapy for the treatment of chronic headaches.

In conclusion, both PCR and ELISA techniques should be used in unison to aid the detection of invasive fungal infections. In conclusion, BG and GM detection are useful tests for the diagnosis of IA in high-risk hematological patients, but a combination of the two tests was very useful to identify false-positive reactions by each test. According to our data, prospective studies in well defined pediatric patients are urgently needed to determine the value of serial Aspergillus PCR assays for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in children at risk. If either GM-EIA or NASBA results suggest IA, the diagnostic yield for IA could be improved, and NASBA could be a useful marker for predicting the clinical course and outcome of treatment. Patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may transiently have a positive test in the early post-transplant period. Physicians should be aware of the possible interference of treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam when interpreting the results of the GM assay. These results favour the use of EIA for early diagnosis and monitoring of aspergillosis in BMT patients, although the predictive value of transient positivity remains to be ascertained. In conclusion, detection of galactomannan by the Platelia Aspergillus test allows for a specific and relatively sensitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in hematological patients with a high and intermediate risk for invasive aspergillosis. Based on these findings, aggressive antifungal therapy should be initiated. Nevertheless, the GM ELISA appears useful to assess IA and to follow the efficacy of antifungal treatment. The 0.5 cutoff may allow for better performance as an early diagnostic test. In patients at high risk for IA, positive results for Aspergillus by PCR of blood samples are highly suggestive for IA and contribute to the diagnosis. These results encourage further evaluation of the Platelia Aspergillus test, to assess its role in the management of invasive aspergillosis in BMT patients. These results indicate that, when CT is used systematically and at an early stage, GM detection in CT-based BAL fluid has a high PPV for diagnosing IPA early in untreated patients. Together, these noninvasive tests should improve the diagnosis of IA. The PCR method seems to be more specific, and a combination of the two should improve the diagnosis of IA. Once accepted galactomannan test as a diagnostic criterium for invasive aspergillosis knowing potential causes of false positive results is of paramount importance. In conclusion, among these weekly screening tests for IA, the double-sandwich ELISA test was the most sensitive at predicting the diagnosis of IA in high-risk patients with hematological disorders, using a reduced cutoff of 0.6 O.D.I. The GM EIA is a useful diagnostic toolfor the diagnosis and monitoring of the course oflA in the presented institute. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. A new cutoff value for the ELISA of 0.700 is proposed for non-allo-HSCT adults. The disappointing sensitivity associated with the presence of rare false-positive cases underlines the limits of this test. In addition to serial screening for GM antigenemia and radiological surveillance, PCR-ELISA may improve the rates of early diagnosis of IA and the management of patients with hematological malignancies. However, further evaluation in prospective studies is required. The test is troubled by a low sensitivity and high frequency of false-negative tests. A better understanding of the kinetics of the GM in different clinical situations is necessary to maximize the benefit of the test in Aspergillus surveillance. These findings have direct implications for preventive strategies, because the diagnostic utility of the antigen assay is compromised during receipt of prophylactic or empirical antifungal therapies. Further evaluation of PCR assays for the diagnosis of IA and other invasive fungal infections is warranted. It is therefore unsuitable for screening of asymptomatic patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis, but does have a useful role in confirming the diagnosis in symptomatic patients. Prospective screening for GM allows earlier diagnosis of aspergillosis than do conventional diagnostic criteria. A cutoff OD index of 0.5--identical to the approved cutoff in the United States--improves the overall performance of the PA-EIA for adult hematology patients. However, the clinical benefit of lower cut-offs (particularly for earlier diagnosis) depends upon the kinetics of antigenaemia and the intensity of serum sampling. Regular monitoring of the kinetics of GM-EIA indices is a useful predictor of clinical course and outcome. Galactomannan detection in serum could be useful for an early diagnosis of IA in OLT recipients. Although the ELISA test did not appear to play a role in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and in the anticipation of antifungal therapy in our experience, it clarifies the diagnosis of infection in probable or possible invasive aspergillosis especially when the cutoff value is lowered and is useful for monitoring patients receiving specific therapy. In the clinical setting, the decision to administer mold-active treatment should based on detection of new pulmonary infiltrates on CT performed early during infection, rather than on results of EIA for detection of GM. Although the ELISA test did not have any role in the anticipation of the diagnosis, it clarifies the diagnosis of IA in allo-HSCT.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8489518166,"bertscore_r":0.7957721353,"bertscore_f":0.8215022683,"rouge1_p":0.4375,"rouge1_r":0.1261261261,"rouge1_f":0.1958041958,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.28125,"rougeL_r":0.0810810811,"rougeL_f":0.1258741259,"rougeLsum_p":0.28125,"rougeLsum_r":0.0810810811,"rougeLsum_f":0.1258741259,"ei_score":0.1068874829,"claimver":0.3964910209,"sts":0.4290764034,"nli":0.5187293291},"entities":[["hematological patients with a high and intermediate risk for invasive aspergillosis","PAR"],["olt recipients","PAR"],["high - risk patients with hematological disorders","PAR"],["high - risk hematological patients","PAR"],["yield","OUT"],["pediatric children at risk","PAR"],["patients with hematological malignancies","PAR"],["galactoman","INT"],["asymptomatic patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis patients","PAR"],["allo - hsct adults","PAR"],["patients","PAR"],["piperacillin - tazobactam","INT"],["patients at high risk for ia","PAR"],["galactomannan test","INT"],["sensitivity","OUT"],["bmt patients","PAR"],["patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","PAR"],["adult hematology patients","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is no evidence to support the use of immunocapture tests for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients.

In conclusion, TAE has a marked antitumoral effect associated to a slower growth of the tumor, but it does not improve the survival of patients with nonsurgical HCC. TAE has a limited use in suppressing local recurrence when performed before PEIT but not before RFA. In our randomized study, lipiodol chemoembolization did not improve the survival of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with tamoxifen. Postoperative TACE combined with PVC may benefit the survival of patients with HCC complicated by PVTT in the short-term (less than 60 months), but long-term efficacy is not yet certain and needs to be confirmed by further studies. In a group of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma but without severe liver disease, lipiodol chemoembolization reduced tumor growth, often caused acute liver failure, and did not significantly improve survival. Preoperative TACE regimens may enhance apoptosis of HCC cells by up-regulating the expression of Bax protein and down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2 protein and ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax protein expression. In conclusion, this study suggests that TACE improves neither the survival nor the quality of life in patients with HCC and cirrhosis. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates were 38.9%, 0%, 0%, and 0% for the patients who underwent palliative resection only, and were 68.3%, 32.3%, 21.5%, and 21.5% respectively for the patients undergoing TACE 3-4 weeks after palliative hepatectomy (P < 0.001). Chemoembolisation improved survival of stringently selected patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Postoperative TACE plus Talpha(1) treatment for HCC patients does not decrease the recurrence rate but may delay its occurrence and prolong surviving time. In conclusion, in Asian patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, transarterial Lipiodol chemoembolization significantly improves survival and is an effective form of treatment.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9402931929,"bertscore_r":0.8989088535,"bertscore_f":0.9191353917,"rouge1_p":0.5,"rouge1_r":0.3461538462,"rouge1_f":0.4090909091,"rouge2_p":0.2941176471,"rouge2_r":0.2,"rouge2_f":0.2380952381,"rougeL_p":0.5,"rougeL_r":0.3461538462,"rougeL_f":0.4090909091,"rougeLsum_p":0.5,"rougeLsum_r":0.3461538462,"rougeLsum_f":0.4090909091,"ei_score":0.0015980878,"claimver":0.8218289614,"sts":0.7069010735,"nli":0.8082557321},"entities":[["tae","INT"],["local recurrence","OUT"],["1 - 2 - 3 -, and 4 - year survival rates","OUT"],["patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with","PAR"],["patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma but without severe liver disease","PAR"],["recurrence rate","OUT"],["patients with nonsurgical hcc","PAR"],["patients with hcc complicated by pvtt","PAR"],["patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma","PAR"],["tamoxifen","INT"],["chemoembolisation","INT"],["tace pvc","INT"],["lipiodol chemoembolization","INT"],["transarterial lipiodol chemoembolization","INT"],["hcc patients","PAR"],["survival quality of life","OUT"],["asian patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma","PAR"],["##al","OUT"],["patients with hcc and cirrhosis","PAR"],["apoptosis","OUT"],["chemoembolization","INT"],["survival","OUT"],["tace","INT"],["tace plus talpha ( 1 )","INT"],["tumor growth liver failure survival","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is no evidence that chemoembolization is superior to other modalities for the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Nonconfrontational treatment may significantly enhance outcomes for DWI offenders with ASPD when delivered in an incarcerated setting, and in the present study, such effects were found in a primarily American-Indian sample. However, clients with more severe personality disorder symptoms demonstrated better utilization of SAC than DFST. It is concluded that MACT has value in preventing self-harm cost effectively but this appears to be confined mainly to those who do not have BPD. Problem-solving plus psychoeducation has potential as a preliminary intervention for adults with personality disorder. Providing case management services to IDUs with comorbid ASPD may facilitate treatment entry and reduce the negative consequences of drug abuse. The three therapist-related factors were moderately associated with each other. It is feasible to carry out a rigorous randomized controlled trial in this group. These findings support the development of interventions more tailored to drug-dependent patients with APD.

Coprescription of ribavirin and stavudine has no short-term impact on plasma HIV RNA level in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients treated with stavudine as a part of their antiretroviral treatment; this coprescription can be safely used, although an in vivo interaction between ribavirin and stavudine is possible. In conclusion, SVR was achieved in 19% of HIV\/HCV coinfected subjects treated with daily IFN plus RBV, but the effectiveness of therapy was substantially diminished by relatively high rates of treatment-related toxicity. EVR assessment at week 8 may become a useful stategy in the management of therapy. Frequent monitoring of virological response may be very helpful to optimize treatment compliance, to tailor treatment duration and to minimize side effects. PEG-INF + RBV was significantly more effective than INF + RBV for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV co-infected patients, mainly of genotype 1 or 4. Eligibility for the study was unexpectedly low. In combination with ribavirin, treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is more effective than standard interferon alfa-2b for HCV infection in HIV-infected patients. Since HCV-related liver disease is currently one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients, new treatment options are urgently needed for coinfected individuals. Patients with no early virologic response did not have any probability of sustained response.

Because the differences between fluoxetine and placebo in the continuous outcome measures did not reach statistical significance, further studies with larger study groups and longer treatment periods are required to conclusively demonstrate efficacy of fluoxetine for seasonal affective disorder.

The eyes that underwent Ahmed tube shunt implantation had more complications than those treated with ECP. Visual acuities, implant-related complications, and average IOPs were statistically indistinguishable between the two groups. The incidence of a hypertensive phase was lower than reported in previous studies. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Postoperative visual acuity, glaucoma medications, and complications were not statistically different. Surface area expansion with pericardial membrane (Preclude) in AGV implant surgery resulted in a statistically significantly lower rate of hypertension without causing any postoperative complications. Mitomycin C did not increase the short- or intermediate-term success rates of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implantation. All other results, including success (as defined in this study) and frequency of complications, were comparable between the two groups. There was no significant difference in final success rate between the partial ligation and nonligation groups. With longer follow-up, the IOPs and the cumulative probabilities of success were comparable between the two groups. Results of this study are limited by a small number of patients in each group and a fixed dose of MMC. Double-plate Molteno implantation more frequently affords IOP control than single-plate Molteno implantation; however, double plates are associated with greater risks of choroidal hemorrhages and\/or effusions, corneal decompensation, flat anterior chambers, and phthisis bulbi. Because the ridge effect is unpredictable, further modifications are necessary to prevent postoperative hypotony. This study suggests that HAD implantation is an effective method in the management of refractory glaucoma in spite of its unneligible complications and combined with MMC can improve the prognosis.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8985462189,"bertscore_r":0.8558623195,"bertscore_f":0.8766849637,"rouge1_p":0.5217391304,"rouge1_r":0.1791044776,"rouge1_f":0.2666666667,"rouge2_p":0.0454545455,"rouge2_r":0.0151515152,"rouge2_f":0.0227272727,"rougeL_p":0.4347826087,"rougeL_r":0.1492537313,"rougeL_f":0.2222222222,"rougeLsum_p":0.4347826087,"rougeLsum_r":0.1492537313,"rougeLsum_f":0.2222222222,"ei_score":0.030580395,"claimver":0.7277464867,"sts":0.6561112404,"nli":0.7330532074},"entities":[["iop control","OUT"],["choroidal hemorrhages and \/ or effusions, corneal decompensation, flat anterior chambers, and phthisis bulbi","OUT"],["mmc","INT"],["ecp","INT"],["success frequency of complications","OUT"],["ahmed tube shunt","INT"],["incidence of a hypertensive phase","OUT"],["surface area expansion with pericardial membrane ( preclude )","INT"],["iops cumulative probabilities of success","OUT"],["collagen synthesis","OUT"],["rate of hypertension","OUT"],["short - or intermediate - term success rates","OUT"],["plate molteno implantation","INT"],["molo","INT"],["complications","OUT"],["mitomycin c","INT"],["postoperative visual acuity, glaucoma medications, and complications","OUT"],["prednisolone","INT"],["final success rate","OUT"],["visual acuities, implant - related complications, and average iops","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of a single-plate or two-plate shunt in the treatment of refractory glaucoma.","annotations":[{"annot_id":1,"annot_task":"main","fluency":2,"population":0,"intervention":1,"outcome":null,"ed_target":1,"ed_generated":-1,"strength_target":1,"strength_generated":0,"ed_agree":false,"strength_agree":false}],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8264023066,"bertscore_r":0.843606472,"bertscore_f":0.8349157572,"rouge1_p":0.1145833333,"rouge1_r":0.34375,"rouge1_f":0.171875,"rouge2_p":0.0421052632,"rouge2_r":0.1290322581,"rouge2_f":0.0634920635,"rougeL_p":0.0625,"rougeL_r":0.1875,"rougeL_f":0.09375,"rougeLsum_p":0.0625,"rougeLsum_r":0.1875,"rougeLsum_f":0.09375,"ei_score":0.0014067005,"claimver":0.4380133152,"sts":0.4736098051,"nli":0.5379844308},"entities":[["plate shunt","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"JB6Z8F","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any one type of surgery for the treatment of refractory glaucoma.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.7765595913,"bertscore_r":0.8338664174,"bertscore_f":0.8041933775,"rouge1_p":0.0384615385,"rouge1_r":0.34375,"rouge1_f":0.0691823899,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.027972028,"rougeL_r":0.25,"rougeL_f":0.0503144654,"rougeLsum_p":0.027972028,"rougeLsum_r":0.25,"rougeLsum_f":0.0503144654,"ei_score":0.0021881506,"claimver":0.4491200447,"sts":0.3846029639,"nli":0.449200511},"entities":[]},{"exp_short":"AQ85CE","prediction":"There is no evidence to support the use of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with collagen overload after Molteno implantation.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8692137003,"bertscore_r":0.8588438034,"bertscore_f":0.8639976382,"rouge1_p":0.3181818182,"rouge1_r":0.21875,"rouge1_f":0.2592592593,"rouge2_p":0.0476190476,"rouge2_r":0.0322580645,"rouge2_f":0.0384615385,"rougeL_p":0.2272727273,"rougeL_r":0.15625,"rougeL_f":0.1851851852,"rougeLsum_p":0.2272727273,"rougeLsum_r":0.15625,"rougeLsum_f":0.1851851852,"ei_score":0.0014614847,"claimver":0.5907252431,"sts":0.5450971723,"nli":0.6140276194},"entities":[["patients with collagen overload after molteno implantation","PAR"],["corticosteroids","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"RQD4RK","prediction":"purposeto evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination of intraoperative mitomycin","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8805921078,"bertscore_r":0.8532169461,"bertscore_f":0.8666884303,"rouge1_p":0.35,"rouge1_r":0.21875,"rouge1_f":0.2692307692,"rouge2_p":0.0526315789,"rouge2_r":0.0322580645,"rouge2_f":0.04,"rougeL_p":0.25,"rougeL_r":0.15625,"rougeL_f":0.1923076923,"rougeLsum_p":0.25,"rougeLsum_r":0.15625,"rougeLsum_f":0.1923076923,"ei_score":0.00376713,"claimver":0.5389553308,"sts":0.4095755816,"nli":0.5287894607},"entities":[["intraoperative mitomycin","INT"],["efficacy safety","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"VNCH8M","prediction":"Adjunctive mitomycin C reduces intraocular pressure and visual acuity in patients with refractory glaucoma.

The data do not support the routine use of any the currently available anticoagulants in acute ischaemic stroke.","predictions":[{"exp_short":"SPNXTA","prediction":"Direct thrombin therapy in patients with acute stroke reduces the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism, but there is no evidence of benefit on mortality.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8754630089,"bertscore_r":0.8567205071,"bertscore_f":0.8659904003,"rouge1_p":0.3,"rouge1_r":0.18,"rouge1_f":0.225,"rouge2_p":0.0689655172,"rouge2_r":0.0408163265,"rouge2_f":0.0512820513,"rougeL_p":0.2333333333,"rougeL_r":0.14,"rougeL_f":0.175,"rougeLsum_p":0.2333333333,"rougeLsum_r":0.14,"rougeLsum_f":0.175,"ei_score":0.0630867617,"claimver":0.6902513504,"sts":0.6663815975,"nli":0.7402473688},"entities":[["direct thrombin therapy","INT"],["dvt and pulmonary embolism","OUT"],["patients with acute stroke","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"6GBRY0","prediction":"Because of the small number of patients it is impossible to evaluate the safety. Low-dose calcium heparin given subcutaneously following acute stroke reduced the number of deep-vein thromboses, pulmonary emboli and deaths without increasing the number of haemorrhagic strokes in this study. Results of this study do not support the use of intravenous heparin to treat patients who have had acute partial stroke. These results suggest that argatroban provides safe anticoagulation in acute ischemic stroke, warranting future studies powered to evaluate its efficacy and more precisely estimate event rates. Numerous standard laboratory tests confirmed that CY 222 was well tolerated. Despite an apparent positive response to treatment at 7 days, emergent administration of the antithrombotic agent, ORG 10172, is not associated with an improvement in favorable outcome at 3 months. These results suggest that the longer a patient remains without DVT prophylaxis after a stroke, the greater the risk of developing DVT and this supports early prophylaxis before rehabilitation. We conclude that LMW heparin in the dose range studied did not provide efficient prophylaxis against DVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The mesoglycan was very well tolerated and no side-effects were observed during the treatment.

Results indicate that health-care providers can be taught to employ adaptive coping strategies that improve levels of burnout, but long-term changes are achieved only through long-term coping training. It is suggested that even brief teaching of relaxation techniques may reduce work stress levels and promote a sense of psychophysiologic health in Chinese nurses who are employed in large teaching hospitals in Taiwan. The data also demonstrate the need to consolidate the skills acquired by regular post-training sessions. Implications of these findings are discussed. We suggest that psychosocial empowerment programmes are beneficial when organizational changes are enacted in health care settings. The implications of this study for clinical practice and future research will be discussed. Although results outline PTP efficacy, they indicate the need to design PTP, amplifying the transfer of learned CS to clinical practice. Outcomes suggest the need for further research with a larger population to assess this intervention's impact on anxiety, stress, self-care and caring relationships. A cost-effective, 6-session RMM protocol reduces burnout and mood dimensions, as well as TMD, in long-term care workers. Overall, the results indicate clear support for the effectiveness of assertiveness training for treating subassertive behaviors and stress in a population of professional nurses in Taiwan. The application of relaxation training in enhancing mental health status for nurses and health professionals is discussed. In these new studies, special attention should be given to the optimization of the implementation process of emotion-oriented care programs.

It is concluded that cardiac pacing does not prevent or even delay the onset of postural syncope and infer that bradycardia is an unimportant component of vasovagal attacks. A possible placebo effect of pacemaker implantation occurred in 22% of patients. Recurrence of syncope after the investigative protocol was infrequent over long-term follow-up regardless of treatment group. In this small, but tightly controlled, study, propranolol did not prevent tilt-induced vasodilatation, syncope or elevated plasma adrenaline. Midodrine is recommended for the treatment of neurocardiogenic syncope in patients with frequent symptoms. Randomized controlled studies are essential to assess the real usefulness of any proposed therapy for patients with vasovagal syncope. There was no advantage with high rate intervention in delaying the loss of consciousness (or intolerable symptoms) after the initial onset of symptoms. The efficacy of therapy seems to be not predicted by HUT. These data suggest that DDD pacing with rate drop response function is effective in cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope and may be preferable to DDI pacing with rate hysteresis. DDD pacing with rate-drop response function is more effective than beta-blockade for the prevention of syncopal recurrences in highly symptomatic vasovagal fainters with relative bradycardia during tilt-induced syncope. The reproducibility of acute tilt-table testing is only 63% and suggests caution in the interpretation of acute drug testing during tilt-table studies. In both groups, HUTT performed one month after the treatment had no role in prediction of responders. Because of the weak evidence of efficacy of pacemaker therapy and the risk of complications, pacemaker therapy should not be recommended as first-line therapy for patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The results of this pilot study suggest that treatment of vasodepressor CSS with midodrine significantly reduced the rate of symptom reporting and attenuated SBP decreases after CSM but increased mean 24-hour ambulatory BP. Dual-chamber pacing with rate-drop response reduces the likelihood of syncope in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. The optimum pacing mode for individual patients cannot be predicted by simple cardiovascular tests before pacing. A negative result of tilt testing was not a useful means to evaluate therapy efficacy.

Our patients declined at a pace slower than that observed in other prospective studies, a finding likely due to selection criteria, avoidance of neuroleptic therapy, and strong psychosocial support.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9231495857,"bertscore_r":0.9001455307,"bertscore_f":0.9115024209,"rouge1_p":0.6363636364,"rouge1_r":0.4516129032,"rouge1_f":0.5283018868,"rouge2_p":0.3333333333,"rouge2_r":0.2333333333,"rouge2_f":0.2745098039,"rougeL_p":0.5454545455,"rougeL_r":0.3870967742,"rougeL_f":0.4528301887,"rougeLsum_p":0.5454545455,"rougeLsum_r":0.3870967742,"rougeLsum_f":0.4528301887,"ei_score":0.0014651395,"claimver":0.9082292318,"sts":0.7961016297,"nli":0.8684899211},"entities":[["progression motor tests and pet studies","OUT"],["cr","INT"],["antioxidant therapy","INT"],["huntington'disease","PAR"],["functional, neuromuscular, and cognitive status","OUT"],["patients with stage i to iii hd","PAR"],["muscle functional capacity","OUT"],["subjects patients with neuromuscular disease","PAR"],["ethyl epa","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any pharmacological intervention for the treatment of patients with neuropsychiatric disease.

Although LNG and NETA affected secondary markers differently, both OC formulations produced an equivalent decrease in bioavailable. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrates that a low-dose OC containing 20 microg of EE and 100 microg of LNG is an effective and safe treatment for moderate acne. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Both desogestrel\/ethinylestradiol and gestodene\/ethinylestradiol provide effective oral contraception with comparable cycle control and acceptability. The reduction in acne with the combiphasic oral contraceptive was comparable to a preparation containing the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate. Furthermore, the effects of both oral contraceptives were comparable. Oral contraceptives containing EE\/desogestrel and EE\/levonorgestrel were both effective in treating acne. During treatment with both preparations all values measured were within the normal range. In addition to its contraceptive efficacy described elsewhere, EE\/CMA is an effective treatment for moderate papulopustular acne and other androgen-related skin disorders. These data show that NOMAC\/E2 provides high contraceptive efficacy with acceptable cycle control as well as an overall adverse event profile similar to that of DRSP\/EE. In conclusion, owing to the unique pharmacologic activities of drospirenone, the combined oral contraceptive EE\/DRSP provides an effective treatment option in female patients with mild to moderate acne. The decrease in 3 alpha-17 beta-androstanediol was statistically significantly more pronounced in the Diane-35 group. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel This new preparation may provide useful hormone therapy for women with androgen-dependent disorders who also require contraception. EE\/DNG was superior to placebo, in spite of the prominent placebo effects, and as effective as EE\/CPA in the treatment of mild to moderate acne, thus proving a valid option for the treatment of acne in women seeking oral contraception. The 3 mg drsp\/20 mcg EE 24\/4 regimen COC was significantly more effective than placebo in treating moderate acne vulgaris. In conclusion, the biochemical and clinical efficacy of EE-GTD and EE-DSG indicate that both these preparations can be a good choice in the therapy of acne vulgaris, with a non-significant better clinical result with EE-DSG. A low-dose oral contraceptive containing EE\/LNG is effective and safe for the treatment of moderate acne. A triphasic combination of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is an effective treatment for moderate acne vulgaris in women with no known contraindication to OC therapy. It is likely that the improvement was in connection with the free testosterone decrease and the improvement was better in the desogestrel\/EE group where also SHBG elevation was seen. The safety profile was consistent with low-dose combined oral contraceptive use. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc. An OC containing 0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol combined with the triphasic regimen of norgestimate is a safe and effective treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women with no known contraindication to OC therapy. Both Marvelon and Diane are effective in the treatment of acne in Oriental women who also need reliable contraception, without marked differences between the preparations.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9057353139,"bertscore_r":0.8708879948,"bertscore_f":0.8879699707,"rouge1_p":0.5909090909,"rouge1_r":0.2096774194,"rouge1_f":0.3095238095,"rouge2_p":0.2857142857,"rouge2_r":0.0983606557,"rouge2_f":0.1463414634,"rougeL_p":0.3636363636,"rougeL_r":0.1290322581,"rougeL_f":0.1904761905,"rougeLsum_p":0.3636363636,"rougeLsum_r":0.1290322581,"rougeLsum_f":0.1904761905,"ei_score":0.0032449577,"claimver":0.5785194635,"sts":0.674451232,"nli":0.7260563374},"entities":[["ee \/ desogestrel ee \/ levonorgestrel","INT"],["ee \/ lng","INT"],["combiphasic cyproterone acetate","INT"],["nomac \/ e2","INT"],["ee - gtd ee - dsg ee","INT"],["acne","OUT"],["drospirenone ee \/ drsp","INT"],["drsp placebo","INT"],["women seeking oral contraception","PAR"],["desogestrel \/ ethinylestradiol gestodene \/ ethinylestradiol","INT"],["contraceptive efficacy event","OUT"],["women with androgen - dependent disorders who also require contraception","PAR"],["therapy","PAR"],["marvelon diane","INT"],["ee \/ cma","INT"],["in acne","OUT"],["bioavailable","OUT"],["oc","INT"],["safety profile","OUT"],["norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol","INT"],["oriental women who also need reliable contraception","PAR"],["shbg elevation","OUT"],["safe","OUT"],["female patients with mild to moderate acne","PAR"],["physical well - being","OUT"],["ee \/ dng placebo ee cpa","INT"],["efficacy","OUT"],["acceptability","OUT"],["desogestrel \/ ee","INT"],["ethinyl estradiol norgestimate","INT"],["free testosterone decrease","OUT"],["placebo ee lng","INT"],["women with no known contraindication to","PAR"],["3 alpha - 17 beta - androstanediol","OUT"],["women with no known contraindication to oc therapy","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral contraceptives for the treatment of moderate to severe acne.

Since neuropsychological improvements were best documented after 8 and 16 weeks and faded towards the end of the treatment period, it must be concluded that this symptomatic therapy is mainly of short-term benefit and was overcome by the progressive pathological changes at the end of the treatment period. Results suggest that although face-name training, spaced retrieval, and cognitive stimulation may produce small gains in learning personal information and on a measure of attention, improvement does not generalize to overall neuropsychologic functioning or patient quality of life. Our results suggest that computer based cognitive training in patients with AD and mild cognitive decline is effective at least in delaying the continuous progression of cognitive impairment in AD. CR offers a means of assisting people with early-stage AD and their families in managing the effects of the condition. These results suggest that although modest gains in learning and memory may be evident in AD patients who are taught specific strategies, the benefits do not generalize to other measures of neuropsychological functioning after a brief intervention.

The results suggest that routines like those implemented through intensified primary care may be an effective strategy to increase the accessibility and continuity of care, especially for elderly people and for patients with a need for long-term contacts. Copyright 2001 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain. Early discharge seems to enhance the opportunity for social support within the family. An intervention including patient education, a pain diary, and defining a procedure for therapeutic adjustments can be effective to improve pain relief in outpatients with cancer. Experienced nurses with specialized knowledge of oncology symptom assessment and management may reduce the symptom burden experienced by ambulatory patients with breast or lung cancer during active treatment. Additional research is needed to test home care interventions aimed at maintaining quality of life outcomes and their effects on survival of post-surgical cancer patients. We suggest that telephone follow-up be coordinated among health professionals. (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. More research is needed to improve the quality of care for inpatients with cancer-related pain. These findings suggest that comprehensive pain assessment and evidence-based analgesic decision-making processes do enhance usual pain outcomes. This coordinating service made little difference to patient or family outcomes, perhaps because the service did not have a budget with which it could obtain services or because the professional skills of the nurse-coordinators may have conflicted with the requirements of the coordinating role. The findings of the current study indicated that a computer-assisted, nurse-driven intervention was capable of providing durable improvements in the quality of life of men who underwent treatment for clinically localized prostate carcinoma. Results support the important role of nurses in addressing mental health issues in patients and families experiencing cancer. Randomised trials may prove to be impracticable for evaluation of palliative care. Factors such as the long-standing relationship women had with their GP, the perceived lack of specialist knowledge on the part of GPs and district nurses, and the women's perception that information seeking was not a tangible reason for primary care contact had an impact on information-seeking behaviour. Nurse led follow up was acceptable to lung cancer patients and general practitioners and led to positive outcomes. When discussing follow-up with breast cancer patients, they should be provided with complete and accurate information about the goals, expectations, and limitations of the follow-up programme so that they can make an informed choice. Continued access to pain related information using either a patient- or provider-initiated format did not affect long-term pain outcomes. However, if given the choice, most patients prefer to stay in hospital until their wound drains are removed. Nurse case management results in more appropriate management of older women with breast cancer. This intervention could have widespread application. Future research should consider providing the feedback to other health professionals and patients, and monitor the impact on the process of individual patient care. lower in the HBHC sample, indicating that expansion of VA HBHC to serve terminally ill veterans would increase satisfaction with care at no additional cost. There were significant reductions in functional decline with inpatient geriatric evaluation and management and improvements in mental health with outpatient geriatric evaluation and management, with no increase in costs. Age, sex, site or stage of cancer, and supportive medications did not modify the effect of this cognitive behavioral intervention on symptom severity. It is recommended that it should be made available to patients on request and used by them according to need. A phase III trial targeting patients with inadequate experienced continuity of care is recommended. Case conferences between GPs and specialist palliative care services may be warranted for palliative care patients. Further research should focus on identifying features such as feedback loops that are required for the successful and meaningful use of QOL questionnaires in routine patient care. With knowledge of the role that continuing-care intervention plays in social support and disease uncertainty, nurses and other healthcare professionals can continue to explore and strengthen strategies to enhance the coping ability of women with breast cancer in Taiwan. A supplementary patient-held record for radiotherapy outpatients appears to have no effect on satisfaction with communication, participation in care, or quality of life. Routine assessment of cancer patients' HRQL had an impact on physician-patient communication and resulted in benefits for some patients, who had better HRQL and emotional functioning. While no statistically significant improvements in patient satisfaction or GP confidence were shown, the data suggested that GPs value contact to meet patient information needs. However, to achieve improvements on a group level of the various dimensions of quality of life, specific interventions directed toward specific symptoms or problems may have to be defined, evaluated, and included in the program. Oncology nurses should develop telenursing programs that include patient and family education regarding oncology issues. Colon cancer patients with follow-up led by surgeons or general practitioners experience similar outcomes, although patterns of investigation vary. These data reflect a high standard of care of patients dying of cancer and other chronic diseases in an acute hospital environment, but do not demonstrate a difference between the two models of service delivery of specialist palliative care. More research is necessary to define cost-effective interventions. While this is a small step in the right direction, the need remains for new initiatives and further studies into how to improve cooperation and communication between the primary and secondary healthcare sectors. However, identification of patients with moderate or severe levels of depression may be valuable in reducing subsequent levels of depression. Future studies should focus on the long-term systematic incorporation of simple pain-assessment tools into daily outpatient oncology practices as well as on innovative ways to address other aspects of managing cancer pain. Our findings suggest that although reminders have some role in improving cancer pain management, a more intensive approach is needed for a generalized nursing workforce with limited recent exposure to state-of-the-art pain management practices.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.888176322,"bertscore_r":0.8556224108,"bertscore_f":0.8715955019,"rouge1_p":0.4285714286,"rouge1_r":0.0967741935,"rouge1_f":0.1578947368,"rouge2_p":0.15,"rouge2_r":0.0326086957,"rouge2_f":0.0535714286,"rougeL_p":0.3333333333,"rougeL_r":0.0752688172,"rougeL_f":0.1228070175,"rougeLsum_p":0.3333333333,"rougeLsum_r":0.0752688172,"rougeLsum_f":0.1228070175,"ei_score":0.0013076229,"claimver":0.7113654613,"sts":0.6776310802,"nli":0.7400114536},"entities":[["symptom severity","OUT"],["nurse led follow","INT"],["palliative care patients","PAR"],["nurse case management","INT"],["patients dying outside of institutions","PAR"],["terminally ill veterans","PAR"],["outpatients with cancer","PAR"],["colon cancer patients","PAR"],["pain relief","OUT"],["care","INT"],["hrql emotional functioning","OUT"],["computer - assisted, nurse - driven intervention","INT"],["cancer patients","PAR"],["post - surgical cancer patients","PAR"],["patients dying of cancer and other chronic diseases","PAR"],["inpatients with cancer - related pain","PAR"],["radiotherapy outpatients","PAR"],["patients and families experiencing cancer","PAR"],["patient education, a pain diary procedure","INT"],["quality of life","OUT"],["elderly people patients with a need for long","PAR"],["social support","OUT"],["patient satisfaction or gp confidence","OUT"],["men who underwent treatment for clinically localized prostate carcinoma","PAR"],["satisfaction with communication, participation in care, or quality of life","OUT"],["pain outcomes","OUT"],["women with breast cancer in taiwan","PAR"],["symptom burden","OUT"],["patients with","PAR"],["telenursing","INT"],["satisfaction with care","OUT"],["cancer pain management","OUT"],["accessibility and continuity of care","OUT"],["breast cancer patients","PAR"],["older women with breast cancer","PAR"],["functional decline mental health costs","OUT"],["care intervention","INT"],["ambulatory patients with breast or lung cancer during active treatment","PAR"],["depression","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of home nursing for cancer patients.

It is concluded that patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with proximal extension of the thrombus beyond the calf veins should be offered a therapeutic trial with streptokinase. Patients with recently formed thromboses in the lower leg and popliteal veins who underwent 7 days of locoregional lysis treatment with urokinase demonstrated significantly fewer clinical symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome after 1 year than those who received locoregional treatment with rt-PA over a similar period or a control group treated with anticoagulants only. Thus, it seems important to limit the extent of a CVT in order to minimize the long-term sequelae, but administration of SK is not justified due to side-effects. Bleeding complications classified as major were noted in 8\/25 patients receiving the combined treatment. Given the inherent risks for such serious complications, systemic thrombolysis, although effective, should be used selectively in limb-threatening thrombotic situations. When diagnosis was delayed there was a very great risk of permanent damage to the valves. in the short-term patients treated with catheter directed thrombolysis obtained better patency and competence than those treated with standard anticoagulation. At long-term follow-up, three (25 percent) of 12 patients in whom greater than 50 percent lysis was achieved had symptoms of the postphlebitic syndrome, compared with 19 (56 percent) of 34 patients in whom lysis was less than 50 percent (p = 0.07). (1) rt-PA and rt-PA plus heparin cause more clot lysis than heparin alone; (2) the addition of heparin to rt-PA does not improve the lysis rate; (3) DVT treated with heparin is commonly associated with a rise in the transaminase level; (4) heparin does not increase the risk of bleeding from rt-PA therapy; and (5) alternative dosing regimens and modes of administration of rt-PA should be investigated to improve further its efficacy and safety in the treatment of acute DVT. Overt bleeding was noted in 6 patients.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8909040689,"bertscore_r":0.8446168303,"bertscore_f":0.8671432137,"rouge1_p":0.3181818182,"rouge1_r":0.0921052632,"rouge1_f":0.1428571429,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.2272727273,"rougeL_r":0.0657894737,"rougeL_f":0.1020408163,"rougeLsum_p":0.2272727273,"rougeLsum_r":0.0657894737,"rougeLsum_f":0.1020408163,"ei_score":0.0161200847,"claimver":0.5376508832,"sts":0.6129704714,"nli":0.6901067495},"entities":[["patients with recently formed thromboses in the lower leg and popliteal veins","PAR"],["rt - pa anticoagulants only","INT"],["streptokinase","INT"],["lysis rate","OUT"],["thrombolysis","INT"],["clot lysis","OUT"],["overt bleeding","OUT"],["symptoms of the postphlebitic syndrome","OUT"],["permanent damage","OUT"],["heparin","INT"],["anticoagulation","INT"],["of bleeding","OUT"],["clinical symptoms of post - thrombotic syndrome","OUT"],["transaminase level","OUT"],["patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with proximal extension of the thrombus beyond the calf veins","PAR"],["bleeding complications","OUT"],["catheter directed thrombolysis","INT"],["urokinase","INT"],["heparin heparin rt pa","INT"],["rt - pa rt - pa plus heparin","INT"],["rt - pa","INT"],["patency and competence","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of streptokinase in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

We conclude that nifedipine may have a role in the treatment of preterm labor but suggest further careful evaluation of this agent before it is considered for routine clinical use. Oral nifedipine is as effective as magnesium sulfate and terbutaline in arresting and preventing idiopathic preterm labor. The use of nicardipine is an interesting alternative to salbutamol, especially in cases of hypertension, diabetes or maternal cardiopathy. However, the nifedipine group had fewer maternal and fetal complications. Nifedipine was found to be significantly more effective than ritodrine or withholding therapy, and was almost devoid of side-effects. The ease with which a calcium inhibitor can be given suggests that it should be used more frequently in the treatment of threatened premature labour and particularly when there are contra-indications to the use of beta-mimetic drugs. Nifedipine in comparison with ritodrine in the management of preterm labor is significantly associated with a longer postponement of deliver, fewer maternal side effects, and fewer admissions to the NICU. Nifedipine is a valid and well-tolerated alternative among the tocolytic drugs, and apparently does not significantly alter fetal vascular blood flow. Its use is associated with less frequent side effects. Patients who received magnesium sulfate were more likely to have adverse medication effects and recurrent preterm labor.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8850740194,"bertscore_r":0.8689984083,"bertscore_f":0.8769625425,"rouge1_p":0.2380952381,"rouge1_r":0.1785714286,"rouge1_f":0.2040816327,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.1904761905,"rougeL_r":0.1428571429,"rougeL_f":0.1632653061,"rougeLsum_p":0.1904761905,"rougeLsum_r":0.1428571429,"rougeLsum_f":0.1632653061,"ei_score":0.2934729233,"claimver":0.8486183882,"sts":0.5428053737,"nli":0.5524586439},"entities":[["effective","OUT"],["calcium","INT"],["side effects","OUT"],["side - effects","OUT"],["fetal vascular blood flow","OUT"],["maternal and fetal complications","OUT"],["magnesium sulfate","INT"],["nifedipine magnesium sulfate terbutaline","INT"],["nicardipine salbutamol","INT"],["postponement of deliver maternal side effects admissions to the nicu","OUT"],["adverse medication effects and recurrent preterm labor","OUT"],["nifedipine","INT"],["nifedipine ritodrine","INT"],["ritodrine","INT"],["preterm labor","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any calcium antagonists in the management of preterm labor.

Arthroscopy led to greater improvement in maximum interincisal opening after 12 months than arthrocentesis; however, there was no difference in pain.","predictions":[{"exp_short":"SPNXTA","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether arthrocentesis or lavage is superior to surgery in the management of TMJ closed lock.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8829906583,"bertscore_r":0.8389620781,"bertscore_f":0.8604134917,"rouge1_p":0.4375,"rouge1_r":0.1228070175,"rouge1_f":0.1917808219,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.3125,"rougeL_r":0.0877192982,"rougeL_f":0.1369863014,"rougeLsum_p":0.3125,"rougeLsum_r":0.0877192982,"rougeLsum_f":0.1369863014,"ei_score":0.0020113412,"claimver":0.6094779968,"sts":0.6423019767,"nli":0.6627551317},"entities":[["arthrocentesis or lavage","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"6GBRY0","prediction":"Arthroscopy shows better results for functional treatment whereas arthrocentesis and arthroscopy show similar results in pain control.

If HA-coated implants can sustain the forces that threaten the fixation in the early period after implantation, a strong and enduring fixation may be obtained.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9131773114,"bertscore_r":0.8979536295,"bertscore_f":0.9055014253,"rouge1_p":0.5,"rouge1_r":0.3235294118,"rouge1_f":0.3928571429,"rouge2_p":0.1904761905,"rouge2_r":0.1212121212,"rouge2_f":0.1481481481,"rougeL_p":0.2727272727,"rougeL_r":0.1764705882,"rougeL_f":0.2142857143,"rougeLsum_p":0.2727272727,"rougeLsum_r":0.1764705882,"rougeLsum_f":0.2142857143,"ei_score":0.2909575605,"claimver":0.435352087,"sts":0.5704635382,"nli":0.6556752324},"entities":[["fixation","OUT"],["hydroxyapatite","INT"],["motion","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of hydroxyapatite-coated implants in total knee arthroplasty.

We conclude that protocol-directed weaning may be unnecessary in a closed ICU with generous physician staffing and structured rounds. Protocol-guided weaning of mechanical ventilation, as performed by nurses and respiratory therapists, is safe and led to extubation more rapidly than physician-directed weaning. The study suggests that use of the computer-directed weaning system results in fewer arterial blood gas samples, shorter weaning times, and less time spent outside acceptable RR and TV parameters. Daily screening of the respiratory function of adults receiving mechanical ventilation, followed by trials of spontaneous breathing in appropriate patients and notification of their physicians when the trials were successful, can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the cost of intensive care and is associated with fewer complications than usual care. Whether protocols combining respiratory parameters with neurologic measures lead to superior outcomes in this population requires further investigation. These results confirm that the use of a weaning algorithm enables the MV interval and hospital length of stay to be shortened, suggesting that it should be used in the management following cardiac surgery. Mechanical ventilation: weaning. These results, in conjunction with prior studies, suggest that VMPs are highly effective means of improving care, even in university ICUs.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8738635778,"bertscore_r":0.8831077814,"bertscore_f":0.8784613609,"rouge1_p":0.3103448276,"rouge1_r":0.28125,"rouge1_f":0.2950819672,"rouge2_p":0.0714285714,"rouge2_r":0.064516129,"rouge2_f":0.0677966102,"rougeL_p":0.2413793103,"rougeL_r":0.21875,"rougeL_f":0.2295081967,"rougeLsum_p":0.2413793103,"rougeLsum_r":0.21875,"rougeLsum_f":0.2295081967,"ei_score":0.047278535,"claimver":0.535494566,"sts":0.6453483701,"nli":0.7374937534},"entities":[["mechanical ventilation","INT"],["mv interval and hospital length of stay","OUT"],["patients with neurologic diseases","PAR"],["arterial blood gas samples shorter weaning times time spent outside acceptable rr and tv parameters","OUT"],["duration of mechanical ventilation cost of intensive care","OUT"],["adults receiving mechanical ventilation","PAR"],["mechanical ventilation :","INT"],["reintubation","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of a systematic approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.

The available evidence for systematic review of all the randomized trials of calcium supplementation shows benefit in reducing the risk of hypertension and preeclampsia. In addition, there was a small but significant increase in serum ionized calcium levels in the calcium-supplemented group during the treatment period. Pregnant women who receive calcium supplementation after the 20th week of pregnancy have a reduced risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Further research should be directed at understanding the mechanism of this effect and trying to demonstrate a reduction in pregnancy-induced hypertension with calcium supplementation in a larger population. In conclusion calcium supplementation given in pregnancy to nulliparous women reduces the incidence of pregnancy induced hypertension. If confirmed by future research, these results could represent an important preventive intervention for prematurity in high-risk populations. Calcium supplementation during pregnancy did not prevent preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertension, or adverse perinatal outcomes in healthy nulliparous women. A 1.5-g calcium\/day supplement did not prevent preeclampsia but did reduce its severity, maternal morbidity, and neonatal mortality, albeit these were secondary outcomes. These results suggest that calcium supplementation during pregnancy in populations with low calcium intake is a safe, effective, and inexpensive preventive measure that significantly reduces the risk of preeclampsia.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8870569468,"bertscore_r":0.8707123995,"bertscore_f":0.8788086772,"rouge1_p":0.4090909091,"rouge1_r":0.2093023256,"rouge1_f":0.2769230769,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.2272727273,"rougeL_r":0.1162790698,"rougeL_f":0.1538461538,"rougeLsum_p":0.2272727273,"rougeLsum_r":0.1162790698,"rougeLsum_f":0.1538461538,"ei_score":0.0009902533,"claimver":0.6573358178,"sts":0.676761508,"nli":0.7536803484},"entities":[["nulliparous women","PAR"],["calcium","INT"],["pre -","OUT"],["pregnancy","PAR"],["preeclampsia severity, maternal morbidity, and neonatal mortality","OUT"],["hypertension and preeclampsia","OUT"],["calcium supplement","INT"],["hypertensive disorders of pregnancy","OUT"],["serum ionized calcium levels","OUT"],["iranian women at high risk of developing pre - eclampsia","PAR"],["pregnant women","PAR"],["preeclampsia","OUT"],["pregnancy - induced hypertension","OUT"],["healthy nulliparous women","PAR"],["preeclampsia, pregnancy - associated hypertension, or adverse perinatal outcomes","OUT"],["calcium supplementation","INT"],["pregnancy induced hypertension","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is some evidence that calcium supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia.

{"subtask":"Cochrane","review_id":"CD006533","target":"Duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. No differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some SSRIs (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. Unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). This limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. As many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. As for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. In the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. Given that several SSRIs and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy.","predictions":[{"exp_short":"SPNXTA","prediction":"Duloxetine is an effective treatment for the acute phase of major depressive disorder.

The implications of the more subtle differences between these drugs, as well as for interpreting the GBR assessment, are discussed. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 00384033. The present study verifies the utility of duloxetine as an efficacious and safe treatment for both emotional and physical symptoms of MDD in this predominantly Asian patient sample. Tolerability, as measured by TEAEs, and safety were similar to paroxetine 20 mg\/day and consistent with previous published data on duloxetine in the treatment of MDD. These data indicate that duloxetine is efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated and safe. \u00a9Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. Furthermore, these data provide the first demonstration under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions that the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine are maintained during chronic treatment. Escitalopram was superior to duloxetine in acute treatment and at least as efficacious and better tolerated in long-term treatment of MDD.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8528612852,"bertscore_r":0.855660677,"bertscore_f":0.8542587161,"rouge1_p":0.3043478261,"rouge1_r":0.1428571429,"rouge1_f":0.1944444444,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.1739130435,"rougeL_r":0.0816326531,"rougeL_f":0.1111111111,"rougeLsum_p":0.1739130435,"rougeLsum_r":0.0816326531,"rougeLsum_f":0.1111111111,"ei_score":0.7328226079,"claimver":0.5779567957,"sts":0.6613773704,"nli":0.726369977},"entities":[["escitalopram duloxetine","INT"],["tolerated effective","OUT"],["efficacy","OUT"],["efficacious tolerated","OUT"],["duloxetine escitalopram","INT"],["escitalopram","INT"],["tolerability teaes safety","OUT"],["efficacy and tolerability","OUT"],["duloxetine","INT"],["tolerated safe","OUT"],["paroxetine duloxetine","INT"],["asian patient sample","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is no evidence that either duloxetine or escitalopram is superior to placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder.

It is concluded that prednisone pretreatment does not have a beneficial effect in children with CHB. Treatment should be used with caution in patients with cirrhosis and avoided in patients showing signs, or with a history, of decompensated cirrhosis. Moreover, in about 10 percent of the patients treated with interferon, hepatitis B surface antigen disappeared from serum. We conclude that 6 weeks of prednisone followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon is of use in inducing persistent loss of hepatitis B virus DNA (16.1 per cent) and e-seroconversion (12.9 per cent) in a proportion of Chinese HBsAg carrier children: the prednisone probably enhances the immunomodulatory effect of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon. However, the response was significantly better in patients with elevated transaminase levels. Interferon was well tolerated, the side effects being less severe than in adults, and never led to suspension of the treatment. Steroid priming does not potentiate the effect of IFN-alpha. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) On long term follow up (four years), nine out of 28 responders (32.1%) eliminated HBsAg, and four initial non-responders had a late seroconversion. The outcome of the treatment was unrelated to gender and pretreatment activity of transaminases, however, patients with low activity of HBV replication were more likely to respond to therapy than patients with high HBV replication.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8644037247,"bertscore_r":0.7830178738,"bertscore_f":0.8217005134,"rouge1_p":0.375,"rouge1_r":0.075,"rouge1_f":0.125,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.1875,"rougeL_r":0.0375,"rougeL_f":0.0625,"rougeLsum_p":0.15625,"rougeLsum_r":0.03125,"rougeLsum_f":0.0520833333,"ei_score":0.9932769686,"claimver":0.5217661858,"sts":0.5189665556,"nli":0.6516994238},"entities":[["transaminase","OUT"],["interferon","INT"],["response rates active viral replication","OUT"],["patients with cirrhosis patients showing signs with history of decompensated cirrhosis","PAR"],["chinese hbsag carrier children :","PAR"],["children with chb","PAR"],["prednisone 2b interferon","INT"],["children with chronic hb infection","PAR"],["steroid","INT"],["prednisone","INT"],["loss of hepatitis b virus dna e - seroconversion","OUT"],["tolerated side effects","OUT"],["hbsag late seroconversion","OUT"],["hepatitis b surface antigen","OUT"],["prednisone recombinant alpha 2b - interferon","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis.

We conclude that sodium valproate is an effective and well-tolerated prophylactic medication for migraine without aura. In general, the drug was well tolerated and proved to be an effective treatment in migraine. Topiramate dose of 50 mg\/day with fewer side effects in comparison with its higher doses may be an appropriate substitution for first-line migraine prophylaxis such as valproate. Divalproex sodium is an effective prophylactic treatment in migraine and is generally well tolerated. Divalproex is an effective prophylactic drug for patients with migraine headaches and is generally well tolerated. No significant difference was identified between divalproex and propranolol for the prophylaxis of migraine without aura. Due to the lack of additional benefit from higher valproic acid doses (more than 600 mg per day), we recommend daily valproic acid doses of 500 to 600 mg with a target serum level less than 50 microg\/mL for the prophylactic treatment of migraine.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8971377611,"bertscore_r":0.8360147476,"bertscore_f":0.8654984236,"rouge1_p":0.4516129032,"rouge1_r":0.0927152318,"rouge1_f":0.1538461538,"rouge2_p":0.1,"rouge2_r":0.02,"rouge2_f":0.0333333333,"rougeL_p":0.2903225806,"rougeL_r":0.059602649,"rougeL_f":0.0989010989,"rougeLsum_p":0.2903225806,"rougeLsum_r":0.059602649,"rougeLsum_f":0.0989010989,"ei_score":0.0421228001,"claimver":0.443585664,"sts":0.5120220184,"nli":0.6003220081},"entities":[["divalproex","INT"],["tolerated","OUT"],["patients with migraine headaches","PAR"],["topiramate","INT"],["sodium valproate","INT"],["topiramate sodium valporate","INT"],["valproic acid valproic acid","INT"],["divalproex propranolol","INT"],["migraine without aura","OUT"],["migraine headache","OUT"],["divalproex sodium","INT"],["effective safe","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the drugs tested in this review.

{"subtask":"Cochrane","review_id":"CD007693","target":"There should be a balanced consideration between the benefits of topical fluorides in caries prevention and the risk of the development of fluorosis. Most of the available evidence focuses on mild fluorosis. There is weak unreliable evidence that starting the use of fluoride toothpaste in children under 12 months of age may be associated with an increased risk of fluorosis. The evidence for its use between the age of 12 and 24 months is equivocal. If the risk of fluorosis is of concern, the fluoride level of toothpaste for young children (under 6 years of age) is recommended to be lower than 1000 parts per million (ppm).\nMore evidence with low risk of bias is needed. Future trials assessing the effectiveness of different types of topical fluorides (including toothpastes, gels, varnishes and mouthrinses) or different concentrations or both should ensure that they include an adequate follow-up period in order to collect data on potential fluorosis. As it is unethical to propose RCTs to assess fluorosis itself, it is acknowledged that further observational studies will be undertaken in this area. However, attention needs to be given to the choice of study design, bearing in mind that prospective, controlled studies will be less susceptible to bias than retrospective and\/or uncontrolled studies.","predictions":[{"exp_short":"SPNXTA","prediction":"There is some evidence that fluoride toothpaste is associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of dental fluorosis in children aged six to nine years.

However, the prevalence of 'Very Mild' fluorosis was twice as frequent in Dublin than in Freiburg. Parents should supervise young children as they brush their teeth with fluoride dentifrice. The prevalence of dental fluorosis was not explained by the risk factors, including fluoride toothpaste usage as explored in this study. High fluoride (1,450 ppm F) toothpastes should not be provided on a community basis to very young children in less deprived communities. Adherence to the guidelines published by the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry is recommended. Copyright 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel There was no significant difference in the prevalence of caries in either primary or permanent teeth although the trend in both cases was for slightly more disease in children who had used the test paste. Respectively similar associations were observed between mild-to-moderate enamel fluorosis on later forming (FRI classification II) enamel surfaces and frequent brushing and fluoride supplement use, but not with infant formula use. Infant formula was not found to be associated with fluorosis on either FRI classification I or II surfaces. Results suggest that children in the four communities may be ingesting a similar level of F from sources such as dentifrices, dietary supplements, and professional applications, but the factor that differentiates them with respect to the prevalence of caries and fluorosis is the F concentration in the community water supply. No association was observed between the use of ready to feed infant formula and enamel fluorosis. Results suggest that toothpaste use in children two years of age and younger should be cautious, limited to follow current guidelines, and supervised by parents to minimize the risk of dental fluorosis. Because the teeth examined in this study were at risk of fluorosis in 1992-95, very soon after policies changed, and because people are slow to change health habits, it seems reasonable to expect a further improvement when teeth mineralised in the late 1990s become visible. Risk factors for fluorosis were use of toothpaste before the age of 14 months and regular use of fluoride supplements during childhood. There was no association between behavior problems and dental fluorosis in this population. The decline was mainly linked with the reduction in exposure to fluoride from fluoridated toothpaste. Fluoride toothpaste use before the age of 6 years is a risk indicator for fluorosis in this study population. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The results suggest prudent use of dentifrice by young children to minimize the risk of fluorosis. The results of the cross-sectional surveys conducted with schoolchildren in 1991, 1995, and 1997 suggest a continuing decrease in the prevalence of dental caries and an increase in the prevalence of dental fluorosis in this nonfluoridated Brazilian town. Dental fluorosis is not a public health problem in East York, but parents should be advised to supervise toothbrushing by children under 2 years of age. An odds ratio of 1.7 associated with infant formula use was suggestive of an increased risk of enamel fluorosis as was an odds ratio of 2.9 associated with fluoride dentifrice use. Copyright 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel The results of the study suggest that toothpaste swallowing may be a factor in the production of fluorosis.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8818557262,"bertscore_r":0.9155825377,"bertscore_f":0.8984027505,"rouge1_p":0.3333333333,"rouge1_r":0.5263157895,"rouge1_f":0.4081632653,"rouge2_p":0.0344827586,"rouge2_r":0.0555555556,"rouge2_f":0.0425531915,"rougeL_p":0.2,"rougeL_r":0.3157894737,"rougeL_f":0.2448979592,"rougeLsum_p":0.2,"rougeLsum_r":0.3157894737,"rougeLsum_f":0.2448979592,"ei_score":0.0009838057,"claimver":0.7870141864,"sts":0.670317173,"nli":0.7312573791},"entities":[["toothpaste","INT"],["prevalence of caries","OUT"],["fluorosis","OUT"],["young children","PAR"],["fluoride toothpast","INT"],["very young children in less deprived communities","PAR"],["fluoride toothpaste","INT"],["enamel fluorosis","OUT"],["prevalence of'very mild'fluorosis","OUT"],["schoolchildren","PAR"],["behavior problems dental fluorosis","OUT"],["children","PAR"],["fluoride","INT"],["caries and fluorosis","OUT"],["prevalence of dental caries prevalence of dental fluorosis","OUT"],["mild - to - moderate enamel fluorosis","OUT"],["breast - feeding","INT"],["children two years of age and younger","PAR"],["east york children under 2 years of age","PAR"],["fluoride dentifrice","INT"],["dental fluorosis","OUT"],["dentifrice","INT"],["fluoride","OUT"],["brazilian","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to determine whether fluoride toothpaste is effective in preventing dental fluorosis.

Conclusion While an additional oral dose of 400 microgram misoprostol did not significantly increase the rate of complete abortion without surgical intervention, the additional dose did significantly reduce the rate of continuing pregnancies without compromising the acceptability and ease of use of the method. These data suggest that pretreatment with tamoxifen is not necessary when using moistened vaginal misoprostol for abortion of pregnancies of <\/=56 days of gestation. Both the 100 and 200 mg doses of mifepristone and the 24- and 48-hour intervals have a similar efficacy to achieve complete abortion in early pregnancy when mifepristone is followed by 800 micrograms of vaginally administered misoprostol. With 12-h intervals, vaginal route should be used, whereas with 3-h intervals either route could be chosen. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The 88% efficacy obtained with vaginal misoprostol alone may be clinically acceptable when mifepristone is not available. It is concluded that the combination of RU486 and a single PG vaginal pessary is a highly effective means of inducing therapeutic abortion in early pregnancy and offers an alternative to surgery. This treatment regimen may offer an alternative to surgical abortion or the use of antiprogestins and prostaglandin for medical abortion. The sublingual route appears superior to the regimen of 400 mcg misoprostol used orally and may be a good option for mifepristone medical abortion. After the administration of mifepristone, vaginal administration of misoprostol is more effective and better tolerated than oral administration for the induction of first-trimester abortion. The regimens of 600 mg or 200 mg of mifepristone, followed by a single oral dose of misoprostol 400 microg 48 hours later, were not sufficiently efficient in inducing abortion when the menstrual delay was > 21 days. The ongoing pregnancy rate was higher than previously reported with vaginal or parenteral administration of prostaglandin. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to assess whether the complete abortion rate can be improved with this regimen. Methotrexate 50 mg\/m2 intramuscularly has the same clearance rates when administered during pregnancy as in a nonpregnant state, and maximum concentrations do not reach sustained toxic levels. Further randomized trials are required to find out the optimal dose of sublingual misoprostol that can give the highest complete abortion rate and lowest incidence of side-effects. Mifepristone taken 300 mg plus misoprostol 1,200 micrograms orally for 6 days is an optimal dose regimen for termination of early pregnancy. Low-dose mifepristone (100 mg) combined with vaginal misoprostol 800 microg may be an effective alternative to regimens using 200 or 600 mg of mifepristone with misoprostol. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00269568 I. This combination may offer an alternative to the use of antiprogestin and prostaglandin for medical abortion. Women receiving mifepristone and vaginal misoprostol for abortion can have the flexibility to administer the misoprostol as soon as 6 hours after using the mifepristone. Should a need arise, a majority of women would choose medical abortion again and would prefer to have it at a health facility rather than at home. Our results indicate that 75 mg mifepristone in capsule form combined with 600 microg misoprostol is as effective and safe as 150 mg mifepristone in tablet form for the termination of pregnancy up to 49 days. The treatment was well tolerated by the women and except for one woman who experienced a profound bleeding necessitating a blood transfusion, no serious side effects were seen. The combination of methotrexate and misoprostol is a more effective abortifacient regimen than when either drug is used alone. Oral methotrexate may be an effective alternative to intramuscular methotrexate in treatment regimens for nonsurgical abortion. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00386867 I. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Thus oral PGE2, when given in clinically acceptable doses, is not a suitable alternative to synthetic PGE analogues for use in combination with RU 486 for termination of early pregnancy. When used for early pregnancy termination with prostaglandin, a lower dose of mifepristone than the currently recommended single 600-mg dose may suffice. Buccal administration of misoprostol after low-dose mifepristone for medical abortion appears to be a highly effective and acceptable alternative compared with vaginal administration for medical abortion in pregnancies through 56 days LMP. This study confirmed the effectiveness of mifepristone and prostaglandin for the induction of early abortion but suggests that more research should be carried out to determine the lowest effective doses of both drugs. The use of methotrexate and misoprostol together could be an alternative to the intramuscular use of methotrexate or the use of antiprogestins and prostaglandin for medical abortion. Besides, it has advantages of convenience of use, less side effects, easy storage and transfer, and low cost. When used after methotrexate for early abortion, the vaginal route for misoprostol is more effective and preferred to the buccal route. This study indicates that for medical abortions induced with methotrexate and misoprostol it is possible to offer both the oral and injected routes of methotrexate without sacrificing efficacy and that about half of the women offered a choice will choose the oral route. The trial demonstrated that although two doses of oral misoprostol were effective, the vaginal misoprostol was more effective at inducing an early medical abortion at 1 day after low-dose mifepristone, and the regimen could be extended to 63 days gestation.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9219662547,"bertscore_r":0.8600198627,"bertscore_f":0.8899163008,"rouge1_p":0.7222222222,"rouge1_r":0.1262135922,"rouge1_f":0.2148760331,"rouge2_p":0.1764705882,"rouge2_r":0.0294117647,"rouge2_f":0.0504201681,"rougeL_p":0.4444444444,"rougeL_r":0.0776699029,"rougeL_f":0.132231405,"rougeLsum_p":0.4444444444,"rougeLsum_r":0.0776699029,"rougeLsum_f":0.132231405,"ei_score":0.0054444741,"claimver":0.851048708,"sts":0.8208782673,"nli":0.8442305923},"entities":[["efficacy complete abortion","OUT"],["women","PAR"],["methotrexate","INT"],["abortions","OUT"],["pge2","INT"],["for abortion","PAR"],["abortion","OUT"],["misoprostol mif","INT"],["rate of complete abortion rate of continuing pregnancies","OUT"],["side effects","OUT"],["misoprostol mifepristone","INT"],["ru486 pg","INT"],["tolerated","OUT"],["efficacy or side effects","OUT"],["mifepristone misoprostol","INT"],["mifepristone vaginal misoprostol","INT"],["therapeutic abortion","OUT"],["mifepristone prostaglandin","INT"],["complete abortion rate side - effects","OUT"],["misoprostol","INT"],["methotrexate misoprostol methotrexate","INT"],["efficacy","OUT"],["tamoxifen methotrexate","INT"],["prostaglandin","INT"],["clearance","OUT"],["methotrexate and misoprostol","INT"],["##rogestin prostaglandin","INT"],["abortion","INT"],["women < 50 days amenorrhoea","PAR"],["abortifaci","OUT"],["effective safe","OUT"],["misoprostol misoprostol","INT"],["prevalence of prostaglandin - related side effects","OUT"],["mifepristone misoprostol mifepristone with misoprostol","INT"],["tolerated profound bleeding blood transfusion serious side effects","OUT"],["methotrexate and misoprostol methotrexate","INT"],["complete abortion rate","OUT"],["methotrexate misoprostol","INT"],["tamoxifen misoprostol","INT"],["complete abortion","OUT"],["mifepristone mifepristone misoprostol","INT"],["early medical abortion","OUT"],["mifepristone","INT"],["misoprostol gemeprost","INT"],["mifistone misoprostol","INT"],["methotrexate methotrexate","INT"],["ongoing pregnancy rate","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of misoprostol for early medical abortion.

{"subtask":"Cochrane","review_id":"CD004740","target":"There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:\nTopical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic\/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic\/steroid.\nThe evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed.\nGiven that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision.\nPatients prescribed antibiotic\/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.","predictions":[{"exp_short":"SPNXTA","prediction":"Oral ear drops containing NCT are as effective and safe as oral drops containing neomycin and dexamethasone for the treatment of AOE.","annotations":[{"annot_id":1,"annot_task":"main","fluency":2,"population":2,"intervention":1,"outcome":0,"ed_target":null,"ed_generated":2,"strength_target":null,"strength_generated":2,"ed_agree":false,"strength_agree":false}],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8737398386,"bertscore_r":0.8264683485,"bertscore_f":0.8494469523,"rouge1_p":0.4375,"rouge1_r":0.1573033708,"rouge1_f":0.2314049587,"rouge2_p":0.064516129,"rouge2_r":0.0227272727,"rouge2_f":0.0336134454,"rougeL_p":0.3125,"rougeL_r":0.1123595506,"rougeL_f":0.1652892562,"rougeLsum_p":0.25,"rougeLsum_r":0.0898876404,"rougeLsum_f":0.132231405,"ei_score":0.4827576271,"claimver":0.7923858166,"sts":0.5781301856,"nli":0.5428466797},"entities":[["neomycin dexamethasone","INT"],["nct","INT"],["safe","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"6GBRY0","prediction":"Hydrocortisone acetate combined with the antibiotics improved individual symptoms better as did the steroid-free ointment. The bacteriological findings and treatment responses do not differ between adults and children. 7 days treatment with CIP\/DEX otic suspension administered twice daily is clinically and microbiologically superior to N\/P\/H otic suspension administered 3 times daily in the treatment of mild to severe AOE, and is equally well tolerated. The two treatments provide rapid and comparable pain relief; however, ofloxacin otic solution does not have the risk of ototoxicity associated with neomycin and provides effective pain relief without adjunctive steroids. Because of its endogenous nature and its higher efficacy, NCT appears to be a good choice for topical treatment of acute otitis externa. It especially leads to an overall reduction of symptoms in cases of moderately or more severe otitis externa and cases lasting for more than 2 days. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that the glycerin formulation of ototopical 0.3% ciprofloxacin appears to be at least as effective as the aqueous form in the treatment of acute external otitis--and in the case of otorrhea, more so. However, low systemic exposure, absence of ototoxicity, and less frequent dosing clearly favor Cipro HC. Larger numbers of infected mastoid cavities are required to be studied. From this study it would appear that antibiotic-based drops confer no real advantage over boric acid in spirit. Therefore, it is recommended that GI dressing can be used instead of an antibiotic dressing as an initial treatment of severe acute otitis externa on the basis of cost, avoidance of resistance and toxicity. Therefore, ciprofloxacillin is at least as effective as gentamicin in such ear infections and has no potential ototoxic effect. The study suggests that an aminoglycoside antibiotic conveys no significant benefit in this condition. Overall, these results support greater pain relief attained over the first 3 d in patients with acute otitis externa treated with CIP\/DEX compared with NPH and a rapid reduction in severe pain after initiation of treatment. Steroid and acetic acid or steroid and antibiotic ear drops are equally effective.

Copyright 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN53107700. B breve can colonise the immature bowel very effectively and is associated with fewer abnormal abdominal signs and better weight gain in VLBW infants, probably as a result of stabilisation of their intestinal flora and accelerated feeding schedules. The results of the present study suggest that very early administration of B. breve to low birth weight infants is useful in promoting the colonization of the Bifidobacterium and the formation of a normal intestinal flora. However, the probiotic supplementation increased the cell counts of bifidobacteria and reduced the cell counts of enterobacteria and clostridia. \u00a9 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved An SB-supplemented formula is well tolerated by preterm infants, it has a beneficial effect on stool flora bringing it closer to that of breast fed babies but it does not improve D-xylose or lipid gut absorption. Infloran as probiotics fed enterally with breast milk reduces the incidence and severity of NEC in VLBW infants. These results suggest that facultative gram-negative enteric bacterial colonization, with either total or aminoglycoside-resistant strains, is not decreased by oral feedings of Lactobacillus acidophilus in premature infants. Supplementation with BB536-LGG may not improve the gastrointestinal tolerance to enteral feeding in very-low-birth-weight infants but may improve gastrointestinal tolerance in infants weighing >1000 g. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 00290576. Probiotics, in the form of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, fed enterally to very low birth weight preterm infants for 6 weeks reduced the incidence of death or necrotizing enterocolitis. However, colonisation with Lactobacillus GG did not reduce the faecal reservoir of potential pathogens and there was no evidence that colonisation had any positive clinical benefit for this particular group of infants. The administration of a bifidobacter supplemented infant formula decreases intestinal permeability of preterm infants and leads to increased head growth. Probiotic supplementation reduced both the incidence and severity of NEC in our premature neonatal population.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9127913713,"bertscore_r":0.8343659639,"bertscore_f":0.8718184829,"rouge1_p":0.8,"rouge1_r":0.0924855491,"rouge1_f":0.1658031088,"rouge2_p":0.3684210526,"rouge2_r":0.0406976744,"rouge2_f":0.0732984293,"rougeL_p":0.55,"rougeL_r":0.063583815,"rougeL_f":0.1139896373,"rougeLsum_p":0.8,"rougeLsum_r":0.0924855491,"rougeLsum_f":0.1658031088,"ei_score":0.1209901929,"claimver":0.6418794394,"sts":0.4265629649,"nli":0.4764117002},"entities":[["lactobacillus acidophilus","INT"],["b. breve","INT"],["permeability","OUT"],["incidence and severity of nec","OUT"],["vlbw infants","PAR"],["lactobacillus gg","INT"],["very low birth weight neonates","PAR"],["gram - negative enteric bacterial colonization","OUT"],["b breve","INT"],["low birth weight infants","PAR"],["faecal reservoir of potential pathogens","OUT"],["bifidobacter supplemented infant formula","INT"],["premature infants","PAR"],["severity nec","OUT"],["stool flora d - xylose lipid gut absorption","OUT"],["infants weighing > 1000 g","PAR"],["sb - supplemented formula","INT"],["probiotics bifidobacterium and lactobacillus","INT"],["enteral feeding hospital stay","OUT"],["premature neonatal population","PAR"],["bb536 - lgg","INT"],["infloran","INT"],["preterm infants","PAR"],["very - low - birth - weight infants","PAR"],["probiotic supplementation","INT"],["incidence intensity of enteric colonization by candida species","OUT"],["abnormal abdominal signs weight gain","OUT"],["gastrointestinal tolerance","OUT"],["cell counts of bifidobacteria cell counts of enterobacteria and clostridia","OUT"],["very low birth weight preterm infants","PAR"],["incidence of death or necrotizing enterocolitis","OUT"],["l. casei subspecies rhamnosus","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics in the prevention of bacterial sepsis in preterm infants.

Ethnic groups may not benefit equally from specialist nurse intervention. Practices where primary care teams received an educational outreach visit demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in uptake in high-risk groups for pneumococcal but not influenza vaccine. An educational program targeted to physicians, nurses, and aides can reduce the use of psychoactive drugs in nursing homes without adversely affecting the overall behavior and level of functioning of the residents. Detailed and prolonged development and testing of behavioural interventions is an essential first step before embarking on randomized controlled trials which involve complex behavioural changes in professionals or patients. are a cost-effective technique for reducing physicians' prescribing costs, and are superior to peer-comparison feedback. Future efforts to promote judicious prescribing should continue to build on growing public awareness of antibiotic overuse. Clinical guidelines implemented with workshops and educational outreach visits improved some but not all aspects of prescribing in the short-term. Retrospective diagnosis may also have obscured a real intervention effect. General practitioners may have considerable public health impact in promotion of health for elderly patients. The project highlights challenges of delivering evidence based care in a setting in which there is a paucity of well controlled trial evidence but where significant health outcomes can be attained. Modification of physicians' tetracycline prescribing behavior was achieved in an actual practice setting by personal visits from peer physicians. There was a decrease in the average prescribing cost of pounds 6.60 per doctor per month in the intervention group compared with the reference group. However, we predict modest savings over a 2-y period. Educational interventions may have to be targeted to specific areas of the practice, with physicians being monitored and receiving ongoing feedback on their performance. A targeted outreach program may improve high-quality reporting of ADRs among physicians. An increase in referral to physiotherapy or educational programmes followed the provision of a triage service. The effectiveness of future interventions may be improved by focusing on patients whose blood pressure is uncontrolled at baseline. However, improving processes of care may not always translate into improvement of specific outcomes. Educational facilitators and volunteer couriers do not seem to be cost effective strategies for distributing smoking interventions. Further work is required to develop effective means to influence prescribing in line with independent guidelines especially in the context of the development of Primary Care Groups. Implementation of evidence-based recommendations improved the provision of nutritional support and was associated with improved clinical outcomes. Academic group detailing\" by pharmacists to primary care doctors can be an effective method for influencing prescribing practices. The reminder-feedback plus educational outreach intervention significantly increased CDE recommendation and performance. Change after mutual practice visits and feedback by peers is more marked than after a visit and feedback by a non-physician observer.

In swabbed postmenopausal women, use of a Milex spatula had a significantly higher yield than the use of a wooden spatula and a cotton-tipped applicator (43 percent vs 27 percent, P less than .03). The use of the latter instrument meant that the number of repeat smears necessitated due to the absence of endocervical cells could be considerably reduced, with consequent improvement in the cost\/benefit ratio. Quantitative studies thus showed that the Aylesbury gave no more accurate results than the Ayre spatula. When endocervical columnar cells are absent, the smear should be considered to be of unreliable quality and a repeat smear should be taken after a short interval, unless the absence of columnar cells can be satisfactorily explained. Their competence in executing their tasks must be frequently reviewed. We recommend that surveillance of patients who have received local ablative therapy for CIN should be by both cytology and colposcopy, and that cytological samples should be obtained using the Ayre's spatula. Regular monitoring of the type described, which is both practical and reasonably comprehensive, is recommended for all laboratories. A large-scale application of the spatula-Cytobrush method should result in fewer repeat smears required and fewer false-negative smears. It is the conclusion of this study that both ectocervical and endocervical sampling should routinely be used. The cotton swab-spatula and Cytobrush-spatula appear to be the most effective screening methods for nonpregnant and pregnant patients, respectively. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) There were major differences in the quality of the smears between the various sample takers. A significantly higher number of moderately and severely atypical epithelial changes was found in smears with endocervical cells as compared with smears without endocervical cells. In terms of the sequence of smears, the second smear generally contained more endocervical cells and less often showed an absence of diagnostic cells. Although the data in the present study were too few to prove that the Armovical spatula is better than the Ayre spatula at detecting cellular abnormalities, it seems likely that this is so. The Cervex seems capable of producing such samples and deserves further evaluation for routine screening. This study illustrates how spurious conclusions of sampling efficacy can be drawn if only one type of indicator cell is used as an endpoint. The endocervical brush is superior to the cotton swab in obtaining satisfactory Papanicolaou smears after cryosurgery, laser ablation and conization. The suggestion of advantage for the Aylesbury spatula merits further investigation. The Zelsmyr Cytobrush cell collector is an effective instrument, yielding increased numbers of endocervical cells on Papanicolaou smear. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) There was no statistically significant difference between the Cytobrush-Ayre spatula and the Cervex brush sampling methods were equally effective in obtaining endocervical cells in Papanicolaou smears. This suggests that smears lacking endocervical cells are less sensitive in screening for dysplasia and should be repeated when clinically appropriate. These findings suggest that, in women who have had laser treatment of the cervix, Cytobrush plus Ayre spatula sampling produces better-quality smears than does Cervex brush sampling, with regard to both adequacy and the presence of endocervical cells. No difference was found between the methods with regard to detection of dyskaryosis, although there were significant differences in the percentage of smears containing endocervical cells. We recommend that an ectocervical sample be obtained only after a straight brush is used to obtain an endocervical sample. Based on the cost per item and a clinically significant increase in endocervical cell yield, we recommend the Cytobrush and modified Ayers spatula for cytologic screening in pregnant women. Therefore the rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) diagnosis is more influenced by an adequate sampling of the endocervix than by the type of endocervical device. We concluded that the Multispatula produces a better quality smear which results in a decreased false negative rate in comparison with the Ayres Spatula. Although it was associated with a slightly increased risk of bleeding, 83% of users preferred the trial spatula. It may be an alternative to the combination of an Ayre spatula and cytobrush for sampling the cervix. Application of the Bethesda System results in a significant number of less-than-optimal smears using either technique.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9006761909,"bertscore_r":0.8559392691,"bertscore_f":0.8777380586,"rouge1_p":0.3888888889,"rouge1_r":0.1186440678,"rouge1_f":0.1818181818,"rouge2_p":0.1764705882,"rouge2_r":0.0517241379,"rouge2_f":0.08,"rougeL_p":0.2777777778,"rougeL_r":0.0847457627,"rougeL_f":0.1298701299,"rougeLsum_p":0.2777777778,"rougeLsum_r":0.0847457627,"rougeLsum_f":0.1298701299,"ei_score":0.1440134618,"claimver":0.8795406818,"sts":0.7304953337,"nli":0.6808205247},"entities":[["women","PAR"],["milex spa","INT"],["swabush","INT"],["##ush ayre","INT"],["papanicolaou smears","OUT"],["ec cin","OUT"],["number of repeat smears cost \/ benefit ratio","OUT"],["patients who have received","PAR"],["women who have had laser treatment of the cervix","PAR"],["for","PAR"],["patients","PAR"],["smears negative smears","OUT"],["of bleeding","OUT"],["quality smear false negative rate","OUT"],["yield","OUT"],["spatula - cytobrush","INT"],["zelsmyr cytobrush cell collector","INT"],["cervex brush","INT"],["pregnant women","PAR"],["endocervical cell yield","OUT"],["moderately and severely atypical epithelial changes","OUT"],["quality of the smears","OUT"],["less - than - optimal smears","OUT"],["endocervical cells","OUT"],["##cal","INT"],["cytobrush modified ayers spa","INT"],["cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( cin )","OUT"],["##re spatula cyto","INT"],["smears","OUT"],["cytobrush plus ayre spatula","INT"],["ablative therapy","INT"],["detection of dyskaryosis percentage of smears containing endocervical cells","OUT"],["endocervical cells absence of diagnostic cells","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any one method of cervical cytology for the screening of women.

These findings suggest that the SBP was as efficient and effective as the CBP but was significantly more comfortable to use for pump-dependent mothers of very low birthweight infants. Of the remaining mothers who produced 1700 g to 3500 g at week 2, 54% achieved adequate production during weeks 4 and 5 postpartum. Mothers' preferences regarding pumping regimen influenced mean milk volumes obtained in the direction of the women's preferences. Further development of interventions to help obese women achieve optimal breastfeeding outcomes is required. As frequent and efficient milk removal is essential for continued production of milk, mothers of preterm infants wishing to express milk for their sick babies should be taught these techniques. Additional studies are needed to determine strategies for increasing milk production in this population. Funded by West Virginia University Department of Research and Graduate Studies HSC Grant # 2U023U; Non-monetary donations of breast pumps and breast pump kits were made by Medela (Medela, Inc., McHenry, IL, USA). Longer-term effects of the relaxation\/imagery approach (such as extending the duration of breast-feeding or reducing parental stress after hospital discharge) and the physiologic basis for the increased volume of expressed milk (improved milk production v more efficient milk ejection) are appropriate topics for future research. Further research is needed to validate these results to better inform breastfeeding women returning to work or school. A student's t-test revealed a significant difference between the two groups; women who performed special breast cleansing before breast pumping had significantly lower bacterial colony counts in their cultured breast milks. The novel, more physiological operation of the MP represents an advance in milk expression technology. We believe that this novel, effective MP, preferred by mothers and costing a fraction of the EP price, reflects a significant advance in milk expression for high-risk infants.breast pumps, randomized trial, preterm infants.

Each of the agents has a favorable adverse-effects profile. Both ketoconazole and griseofulvin were useful drugs for treatment of dermatophytoses in children. Ketoconazole shows promise as an alternative to griseofulvin for treating children with tinea capitis. Adverse events noted were mild and did not warrant discontinuation of therapy. When efficacy, cost, and compliance are taken into consideration, 2 weeks of terbinafine therapy appears to be the optimal treatment duration for patients with Trichophyton tonsurans tinea capitis. The time for complete scalp clearing was significantly longer in patients who received ketoconazole (median, 108 days) compared with those who were treated with griseofulvin (median, 60 days) (P = 0.01). In our opinion, terbinafine given for 1, 2 or 4 weeks, is equally effective for most cases of tinea capitis. Fluconazole constitutes an alternative but, because of greater availability and lower cost, griseofulvin remains the treatment of choice for tinea capitis. Overall, the study showed that 4 weeks of treatment with oral terbinafine has similar efficacy to 8 weeks of treatment with griseofulvin for the management of tinea capitis in children. The drug also appears to be better tolerated than griseofulvin. We conclude that griseofulvin should remain the drug of choice for treating tinea capitis. No significant side effects were reported. tinea capitis, although additional treatment (a third pulse) may be needed if clinical improvement is not evident at 8 weeks after initiating therapy. Terbinafine is well tolerated, and requires 2 weeks of treatment in most patients with Trichophyton scalp infections and 4 weeks or more in Microsporum scalp infections, to achieve a successful clinical and mycological response. However, further clinical trials are required in order to optimize the dose regimen to allow higher cure rates to be reached.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.860999763,"bertscore_r":0.8583729267,"bertscore_f":0.8596843481,"rouge1_p":0.4772727273,"rouge1_r":0.1891891892,"rouge1_f":0.2709677419,"rouge2_p":0.2093023256,"rouge2_r":0.0818181818,"rouge2_f":0.1176470588,"rougeL_p":0.3181818182,"rougeL_r":0.1261261261,"rougeL_f":0.1806451613,"rougeLsum_p":0.3636363636,"rougeLsum_r":0.1441441441,"rougeLsum_f":0.2064516129,"ei_score":0.0084986179,"claimver":0.4097051919,"sts":0.6624836326,"nli":0.7947115302},"entities":[["patients with trichophyton scalp infections microsporum scalp infections","PAR"],["tolerated","OUT"],["children with tinea capitis","PAR"],["griseofulvin","INT"],["time for complete scalp clearing","OUT"],["terbinafine","INT"],["##oses in children","PAR"],["terbinafine therapy","INT"],["effects","OUT"],["fluconazole griseofulvin","INT"],["efficacy","OUT"],["##itis in children","PAR"],["griseofulvin terbinafine","INT"],["ketoconazole griseofulvin","INT"],["adverse events","OUT"],["patients with trichophyton tonsurans tinea capitis","PAR"],["efficacy cost compliance","OUT"],["side effects","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is no evidence to support the use of any of the currently available antifungal agents for the treatment of tinea capitis.

LEF was equally effective as MTX in patients unable to continue MTX treatment due to the drug's ineffectiveness. Improvement in synovial inflammation as measured by IRE was significantly better with leflunomide than with methotrexate over 4 months of therapy. Fewer adverse events were reported in patients switched to LEF without a loading dose. If regular monitoring of hepatic function and hematological parameters are performed, leflunomide is an effective and safe drug in the Indian population in resistant rheumatoid arthritis patients, especially if used alone. Leflunomide plus methotrexate is generally well tolerated and can be used safely with appropriate liver enzyme and hematologic monitoring. LEF had a good therapeutic effect for RA, especially for refractory RA and had slight side reactions, and could be regarded as a superior immunosuppressive agent used in the treatment of RA and other connective tissue diseases. Its efficacy is similar to MTX, but the incidence of adverse events and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events were lower in the leflunomide group than in MTX group. The use of leflunomide in a weekly dose of 100 mg proved to have similar therapeutic benefit as that of the conventional scheme and might represent a new option for the treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients. This drug may be a useful option as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. This study demonstrates that slowing of disease progression with leflunomide, observed as early as 6 months, is maintained long term in patients who complete 2 years of treatment. These findings were clinically meaningful and correlated with the ACR response status. Patient numbers are small and firm conclusions cannot be reached, but a non-significant benefit is indicated for combining leflunomide with sulfasalazine compared with switching to sulfasalazine alone in patients inadequately responding to leflunomide. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials using daily doses of 10 mg and 20 mg are under way in the US and Europe to confirm these positive results. More AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation and SAEs in patients receiving 10 mg leflunomide daily also support a better efficacy profile for the 20 mg daily dose. Results indicate that LEF is a safe and effective initial treatment for active RA, with clinical benefit sustained over 2 years of treatment without evidence of new or increased toxicity. Efficiency of RA treatment with MTX or LEF in intensified doses and in combination with moderate dose prednisone can be sufficiently judged 8 weeks after its initiation. The benefit of leflunomide is reflected in other efficacy criteria, such as global assessments and the American College of Rheumatology response rates, all of which showed significantly more improvement with leflunomide than sulfasalazine at 24 months. These long term data confirm that leflunomide is an efficacious and safe disease modifying antirheumatic drug. Both active treatments improved signs and symptoms of active RA, delayed disease progression as demonstrated by x-ray films, and improved function and health-related quality of life. Adverse events were not substantially increased.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.865938127,"bertscore_r":0.8432015181,"bertscore_f":0.8544186354,"rouge1_p":0.4,"rouge1_r":0.1666666667,"rouge1_f":0.2352941176,"rouge2_p":0.125,"rouge2_r":0.0508474576,"rouge2_f":0.0722891566,"rougeL_p":0.32,"rougeL_r":0.1333333333,"rougeL_f":0.1882352941,"rougeLsum_p":0.32,"rougeLsum_r":0.1333333333,"rougeLsum_f":0.1882352941,"ei_score":0.0053863334,"claimver":0.5579646826,"sts":0.496245265,"nli":0.5966845751},"entities":[["radiographic progression","OUT"],["signs and symptoms of active ra disease progression function and health - related quality of life","OUT"],["leflunomide methotrexate","INT"],["leflunomide","INT"],["placebo","INT"],["lef","INT"],["therapeutic benefit","OUT"],["leflunomide plus methotrexate","INT"],["tolerated","OUT"],["mtx lef prednisone","INT"],["leflunomide sulfasalazine","INT"],["adverse events","OUT"],["refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients","PAR"],["patients inadequately responding to","PAR"],["improvement in synovial inflammation","OUT"],["leflunomide with sulfasalazine sulfasalazine","INT"],["efficacy incidence of adverse events rate of withdrawal due to adverse events","OUT"],["efficacy","OUT"],["reactions","OUT"],["global assessments and the american college of rheumatology response rates","OUT"],["lef mtx","INT"],["indian population resistant rheumatoid arthritis patients","PAR"],["aes treatment discontinuation and saes","OUT"],[") lef mtx ssz","INT"],["le","INT"],["leflunomide mtx","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is some evidence that leflunomide may be more effective than methotrexate or benzylisopropylmethamphetamine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

The magnitude of the acute-phase response was less pronounced following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, consistent with a reduction in tissue trauma. LC is a more cost-effective method for treatment of gallstone disease. Compared to minilaparotomy cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in shorter hospital stay, less postoperative dysfunction, and quicker return to normal activities, but is more costly. Consequently, although laparoscopic cholecystectomy shows a better outcome in terms of socioeconomic aspects and patient compliance, in an attempt to rationalize hospital expenditure, we would advocate mini-cholecystectomy for those patients who do not need to return to work early. There was no significant cost difference between the two procedures. Further analyses of LC versus MC are necessary regarding surgical training, surgical outcome, and health economy. Minimal access surgery induces an acute phase response that is less prominent after a laparoscopic technique. This randomised trial shows the superior effectiveness of LC over MC in treating cholelithiasis. The beneficial effects of laparoscopic surgery may relate, in part, to preservation of immune function in the postoperative period. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy takes longer to do than small-incision cholecystectomy and does not have any significant advantages in terms of hospital stay or postoperative recovery. Patients with LCCE had significant less postoperative pain, less restriction of total vital capacity and a shorter postoperative hospital stay as parameters of a diminished operative trauma.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8601992726,"bertscore_r":0.8334231377,"bertscore_f":0.8465995789,"rouge1_p":0.3333333333,"rouge1_r":0.2307692308,"rouge1_f":0.2727272727,"rouge2_p":0.0384615385,"rouge2_r":0.0263157895,"rouge2_f":0.03125,"rougeL_p":0.1851851852,"rougeL_r":0.1282051282,"rougeL_f":0.1515151515,"rougeLsum_p":0.1851851852,"rougeLsum_r":0.1282051282,"rougeLsum_f":0.1515151515,"ei_score":0.9696587458,"claimver":0.3958251476,"sts":0.5387213826,"nli":0.6829484105},"entities":[["cost","OUT"],["lc mc","INT"],["acute - phase response tissue trauma","OUT"],["hospital stay postoperative","OUT"],["minilaparotomy cholecystectomy laparoscopic cholecystectomy","INT"],["hospital stay postoperative dysfunction return to normal activities","OUT"],["laparoscopic surgery","INT"],["laparoscopic cholecystectomycher incision cholecystectomy","INT"],["postoperative pulmonary function","OUT"],["postoperative pain, less restriction of total vital capacity and shorter postoperative hospital stay","OUT"],["laparoscopic cholecystectomy cholecystectomy","INT"],["effectiveness","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is no evidence that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is superior to open cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic gallstone disease.

Simple interventions can improve ACE inhibitor use and patient outcomes. This management strategy is cost-effective and has an equitable value from a societal point of view. Copyright 2001 The European Society of Cardiology. A hybrid DMP for elderly heart failure patients improves outcomes and is cost-effective over a long-term follow-up. This comprehensive hospital discharge and outpatient management program prolonged time to first event, reduced hospital readmissions, improved survival and quality of life of patients hospitalized for HF, while reducing cost of management. When our results are integrated with those from other, similar trials, multidisciplinary disease management strategies for congestive heart failure are associated with clinically worthwhile improvements in survival. A management programme for patients with heart failure discharged after hospitalisation reduces health care costs and the need for readmission. However, such a programme does not seem to have a favourable influence on QoL or readmission rate during long term follow up. A home-based intervention has the potential to decrease the rate of unplanned readmissions and associated health-care costs, prolong event-free and total survival, and improve quality of life among patients with chronic CHF. More comprehensive health economic evaluation needs to be undertaken. Follow up after hospitalisation at a nurse-led heart failure clinic can improve survival and self-care behaviour in patients with heart failure as well as reduce the number of events, readmissions and days in hospital. More intense follow-up monitoring and more resources are needed to achieve better results. A formal education and support intervention substantially reduced adverse clinical outcomes and costs for patients with HF. Such programs may be less effective for patients at low risk than those at high risk. Specially trained nurses can improve the outcome of patients admitted to hospital with heart failure. A supportive educational nursing intervention is effective in improving self-care behavior in patients with advanced (New York Heart Association class III-IV) heart failure; however, a more intensive intervention is needed to show effectiveness in improving quality of life. Its beneficial effects on recurrent readmission and event-free survival are consistent with those applying either a home or clinic-based approach. Longer-term benefit likely requires more active chronic intervention, even among patients who appear clinically stable. Postdischarge pharmaceutical care allows for reducing the number of new admissions in patients with heart failure, the total days of hospital stay, and improves treatment compliance without increasing the costs of care. Clinical Trial Registry http:\/\/trialregister.nl Identifier: NCT 98675639. ISRCTN59427925. A comprehensive transitional care intervention for elders hospitalized with heart failure increased the length of time between hospital discharge and readmission or death, reduced total number of rehospitalizations, and decreased healthcare costs, thus demonstrating great promise for improving clinical and economic outcomes. This study demonstrates that a six-month, multidisciplinary approach to CHF management can improve important clinical outcomes at a similar cost in recently hospitalized high-risk patients with CHF.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8535769582,"bertscore_r":0.8484745026,"bertscore_f":0.8510181308,"rouge1_p":0.2857142857,"rouge1_r":0.2307692308,"rouge1_f":0.2553191489,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.1428571429,"rougeL_r":0.1153846154,"rougeL_f":0.1276595745,"rougeLsum_p":0.1428571429,"rougeLsum_r":0.1153846154,"rougeLsum_f":0.1276595745,"ei_score":0.590031544,"claimver":-0.0411492288,"sts":0.0760047138,"nli":0.1925675273},"entities":[["formal education and support intervention","INT"],["rate unplanned readmissions and associated health - care costs event - free and total survival quality of life","OUT"],["heart failure patient","PAR"],["patients with chronic chf","PAR"],["patients with heart failure discharged after hospitalisation","PAR"],["survival self - care behaviour","OUT"],["comprehensive transitional care intervention","INT"],["qol or readmission rate","OUT"],["recurrent readmission and event - free survival","OUT"],["days of hospital stay treatment compliance","OUT"],["number new admissions","OUT"],["recently hospitalized high - risk patients with chf","PAR"],["postdischarge pharmaceutical care","INT"],["patients with advanced ( new york heart association class iii - iv ) heart failure ;","PAR"],["management programme","INT"],["elders hospitalized with heart failure","PAR"],["number of events, readmissions and days hospital","OUT"],["elderly heart failure patients","PAR"],["home based intervention","INT"],["health care costs readmission","OUT"],["readmission and death rates","OUT"],["adverse clinical outcomes and costs","OUT"],["patients hospitalized for hf","PAR"],["of life","OUT"],["patients with hf","PAR"],["time to first event hospital readmissions survival and quality of life","OUT"],["length of time between hospital discharge and readmission or death total number of rehospitalizations healthcare costs","OUT"],["patients with heart failure","PAR"],["cost of management","OUT"],["effective","OUT"],["survival","OUT"],["supportive educational nursing intervention","INT"],["self - care behavior","OUT"],["patients admitted to hospital with heart failure","PAR"],["dmp","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is some evidence that outpatient management programs reduce hospital admissions and readmissions in patients with heart failure.

Fosinopril and amlodipine had similar effects on biochemical measures, but the patients randomized to fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of major vascular events, compared with the patients randomized to amlodipine. However, treatment with chlorthalidone was associated with significantly higher incidences of hyperuricemia and hypokalemia than was treatment with verapamil. When considered in the context of other trials of calcium antagonists, these data indicate that the effectiveness of calcium-channel therapy in reducing cardiovascular disease is similar but not better than diuretic or beta-blocker treatment. Recruitment of patients started in September 1992 and so far more than 100 patients\/week have been included. Since our findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation. The verapamil-trandolapril-based strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based strategy in hypertensive CAD patients. The greater efficacy of lacidipine on carotid IMT progression and number of plaques per patient, despite a smaller ambulatory blood pressure reduction, indicates an antiatherosclerotic action of lacidipine independent of its antihypertensive action. The findings emphasise the importance of prompt blood-pressure control in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk. End points include blood pressure change, side effects and quality-of-life indices; incidence of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities; and incidence of cardiovascular clinical events, including death, among participants receiving drugs as first-step treatment as well as nonpharmacologic treatment compared with incidence among those participants randomized to nonpharmacologic treatment only as the initial step. The composite cardiovascular event rate did not differ in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy treated with irbesartan, amlodipine, or placebo in addition to conventional antihypertensive therapy. In elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, administration of lacidipine or chlorthalidone markedly reduced systolic blood pressure with no difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events and total mortality. Nevertheless, the results have implications with respect to optimum combinations of antihypertensive agents. Further features of the rationale, design, objectives, treatment program, and study organization of ALLHAT are described in this article. The choice of drug can be decided by tolerability and blood-pressure response rather than long-term safety or efficacy. The increased incidence of vascular events in patients receiving isradipine compared with hydrochlorothiazide is of concern and should be studied further. Diltiazem was as effective as treatment based on diuretics, beta-blockers, or both in preventing the combined primary endpoint of all stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8819106817,"bertscore_r":0.8483825922,"bertscore_f":0.8648217916,"rouge1_p":0.5238095238,"rouge1_r":0.1392405063,"rouge1_f":0.22,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.380952381,"rougeL_r":0.1012658228,"rougeL_f":0.16,"rougeLsum_p":0.380952381,"rougeLsum_r":0.1012658228,"rougeLsum_f":0.16,"ei_score":0.935451577,"claimver":0.7116351128,"sts":0.590749383,"nli":0.6193896532},"entities":[["fosinopril amlodipine","INT"],["nonpharma","INT"],["blood pressure change, side effects and quality - of - life indices ; incidence of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities ; and incidence of cardiovascular clinical events, including death","OUT"],["patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy","PAR"],["patients with hypertensive renal disease and proteinuria patients without proteinuria","PAR"],["verapamil","INT"],["fosinopril","INT"],["risk of major vascular events","OUT"],["composite cardiovascular event rate","OUT"],["isradipine hydrochlorothiazide","INT"],["irbesartan, amlodipine, placebo","INT"],["diltiazem diuretics","INT"],["incidences of hyperuricemia and hypokalemia","OUT"],["chlorthalidone","INT"],["of all stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death","OUT"],["blood pressure","OUT"],["elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension","PAR"],["vascular events","OUT"],["hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk","PAR"],["systolic blood pressure cardiovascular events and total mortality","OUT"],["carotid imt progression and number of plaques per patient ambulatory blood pressure reduction","OUT"],["amlodipine","INT"],["renal disease progression","OUT"],["lacidipine","INT"],["recruitment of patients started in september 1992 and so far more than 100 patients \/ week have been included","PAR"],["biochemical measures","OUT"],["ramipril amlodipine","INT"],["cardiovascular disease","OUT"],["blood - pressure","OUT"],["calcium - channel therapy","INT"],["hypertensive cad patients","PAR"],["lacidipine or chlorthalidone","INT"],["verapamil - trandolapril atenolol - hydrochlorothiazide","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is some evidence that calcium channel blockers reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with renal disease.

The substance may augment the therapeutic options if injected slowly and after suitable prophylaxis to avoid postoperative nausea and vomiting. Given the necessarily invasive nature of caudal block, we suggest the combined use of diclofenac suppository with local anesthetic infiltration at port sites as a useful and more economical alternative for analgesia following pediatric laparoscopy. Voltarol appears to be the better pre-emptive analgesic for dental extractions under general anaesthesia when compared with paracetamol and no analgesia. We advocate the use of laparoscopy for the diagnosis and treatment of dysplastic kidney with ectopic ureter. Comparative analysis of the efficiency of postoperative analgesia of the above agents has indicated that diclofenac and paracetamol have a sufficient analgesic activity and at the same time do not show the adverse reactions unique to narcotic analgesics. The proportion experiencing moderately severe to severe pain on returning to the ward, as their maximum pain score and pain score at discharge fell from 70 per cent to 48 per cent, 85 per cent to 56 per cent, and six per cent to two per cent respectively. Early recognition of the disease is important to remove possible aetiologic agents and to treat them before chronic lesions are present to avoid long-term renal damage. A comparative analysis of the efficiency of postoperative analgesia by the discussed drugs showed that diclofenac possesses a sufficient analgetic activity and is free of any side-effects inherent in narcotic analgetics. S(+)-ketamine combined with a plain bupivacaine caudal provides no better analgesia than caudal bupivacaine alone, indicating that the principal analgesic effect of caudal S(+)-ketamine results from a local neuroaxial rather than a systemic effect. Our findings suggest that this combined regimen may be a promising prophylactic approach to postoperative pain control in children undergoing ophthalmological surgery. The pre-operative rectal administration of diclofenac for pain relief after adenotomy is safe and effective. Copyright 2000 The British Infection Society. Suppository is reserved for children when oral intake is not possible, and injection should be the last resort. It was therefore concluded that intravenous diclofenac given intra-operatively has analgesic effect in the immediate post-operative period and it is recommended for small children during adenoidectomy. in 1992 revealed that four of the 73 patients (5.5%) receiving diclofenac at induction of anaesthesia suffered reactionary haemorrhage requiring operative control, as compared with two of 293 (0.7%) receiving other analgesics. Preemptive diclofenac given rectally reduced pain intensity and morphine requirements of children anaesthetized with remifentanil for tonsillectomy. The results suggest that sublingual morphine may be a suitable alternative to various other routes of opioid administration in children, but further investigations of the sublingual route of administration of opioids in children are required. Adverse effects and duration of PCA were comparable in the four groups. This property of clonidine indicates that it may be superior to other sedative premedicants such as diazepam and midazolam. The study points out that immediate postoperative comfort obtained by prophylactic analgesia needs to be followed by analgesics given on a continuous basis for the first days after surgery. These two drugs are suitable for short-term analgesia-based sedation in pediatric postoperative ICU patients. It would appear that the combination of a caudal block and rectal diclofenac in children undergoing minor lower abdominal surgery reduces the need for subsequent analgesia. Key points in the management of anaesthesia in KGS are discussed. This study indicates that diclofenac was no more effective than high-dose acetaminophen (90 mg vs. 60 mg kg(-1) 24 h(-1)) for analgesia, but resulted in a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients following tonsillectomy. RF appears to be a safe and reliable method for tonsil surgery with much less postoperative morbidity than regular TE. No serious adverse events were observed. A single intramuscular dose of diclofenac significantly reduces the need for an opioid analgesic in children after inguinal herniotomy or orchidopexy, and owing to its long duration of action, it offers an alternative or complementary method of pain relief to caudal analgesia. There were no significant differences in sedation score between the group of patients who received analgesics and the group of those who did not, and many patients had satisfactory sedation scores in the surgical ward, suggesting that appropriate administration of postoperative analgesics is possible. In both treatment groups there was an association between bleeding and restlessness during recovery so the increased bleeding in the diclofenac group may not be a direct effect. According to the results the preventive analgesia method reduces significantly the postoperative pain and anxiety, which makes the administration of additional analgetics advisable and cuts the child's stay in one-day hospital. glycopyrrolate before the induction of anaesthesia significantly reduced the scores for salivation. In common with the experience of others, it is possible to perform tonsillectomies safely on a same-day basis. This pharmacokinetic profile renders diclofenac suppository a suitable formulation for short duration surgery. nalbuphine or diclofenac suppositories compared with control. Rectal diclofenac is a useful alternative to caudal blockade in this group of patients. Improved oral intake resulted in a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting and allowed safer and earlier hospital discharge. Diclofenac may offer advantages compared to papaveretum with regard to safety and convenience for use in the treatment of pain after tonsillectomy in children. Codeine analgesia is less reliable than morphine, but was not well correlated with either phenotype or plasma morphine in this study. Subjects in Group L required significantly more doses of postoperative analgesia than those in Group C (p < 0.05). Copyright 2004 Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Acceptable pain scores may be achieved by the administration of regular analgesia to these patients. This, combined with supplemental oral paracetamol, obviates the need for opiates, resulting in alert infants who feed well and are suitable for early discharge. The efficacy of diclofenac 0.5 mg x kg(-1) and paracetamol 15 mg x kg(-1) as oral analgesic premedication for BMT was comparable in children receiving an anaesthetic which included intraoperative administration of fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1). Premedication with a small dose of ketamine reduces swallowing-evoked pain after tonsillectomy in children who received an analgesic regimen combining an opioid and a NSAID. Vt and total plasma clearance were higher than in adults but the elimination half-life was similar. The various pharmaceutical presentations and the availability as a noncontrolled substance may make it a useful addition to paediatric anaesthesia if it becomes licensed for paediatric anaesthesia in the UK. The rate of recovery in children after exposure to desflurane was faster than those patients receiving isoflurane; recovery from desflurane, but not isoflurane, was relatively unaffected by the duration of anaesthesia. Parental follow-up questionnaires for the subsequent two days showed no difference in measured parameters between the groups. This is the first case report on colon perforation occurring in an adolescent (16-year-old girl) after short-term diclofenac intake. There were no significant differences between the two drugs in respect of time to awaken from anaesthesia or incidence of postoperative vomiting. Rectal diclofenac was not effective as a single analgesic as compared to other techniques. The median pain scores (2 at 15 min and 1 at 30 min postoperatively) were the same in both groups. The incidence of postoperative haemorrhage and vomiting was low. Children who received the rectal diclofenac-paracetamol combination experienced a lower pain scale and a decreased need for morphine compared with children receiving each drug alone. The subpubic penile block provided significantly better analgesia than the subcutaneous ring block of the penis. The pain scores in the diclofenac with fentanyl group were significantly lower at one h and four h than the group receiving diclofenac alone (P = 0.008 and 0.02 respectively). Administration of rescue anti-emetics, pain scores in recovery and pain scores over the next 24 h were similar between the two groups. Apart from more vomiting with halothane and more discomfort during the first 10 min after awakening with sevoflurane, the quality of recovery was similar with the two anaesthestics.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8607763052,"bertscore_r":0.8736818433,"bertscore_f":0.8671810031,"rouge1_p":0.2916666667,"rouge1_r":0.4117647059,"rouge1_f":0.3414634146,"rouge2_p":0.1304347826,"rouge2_r":0.1875,"rouge2_f":0.1538461538,"rougeL_p":0.2083333333,"rougeL_r":0.2941176471,"rougeL_f":0.243902439,"rougeLsum_p":0.2083333333,"rougeLsum_r":0.2941176471,"rougeLsum_f":0.243902439,"ei_score":0.001024995,"claimver":0.8361997604,"sts":0.5769633055,"nli":0.5896434188},"entities":[["postoperative pain and anxiety","OUT"],["codeine morphine","INT"],["diclofenac paracetamol fentanyl","INT"],["bupivacaine s ( + ) - ketamine","INT"],["clonidine diazepam midazolam","INT"],["nausea and vomiting","OUT"],["patients following tonsillectomy","PAR"],["paracetamol","INT"],["quality of recovery","OUT"],["bleeding and restlessness bleeding","OUT"],["children undergoing minor lower abdominal surgery","PAR"],["pediatric postoperative icu patients","PAR"],["analgetic activity side -","OUT"],["desflurane isoflurane ; desflurane isoflurane","INT"],["pain intensity and morphine requirements","OUT"],["diclofenac with fentanyl diclofenac","INT"],["postoperative morbidity","OUT"],["pain scores","OUT"],["vomiting","OUT"],["nalbuphine or diclofenac suppositories","INT"],["tonsillectomy in children","PAR"],["proportion experiencing moderately severe to severe pain maximum pain score and pain score","OUT"],["incidence of nausea and vomiting hospital discharge","OUT"],["comfort","OUT"],["for tonsillectomy","PAR"],["small children during adenoidectomy","PAR"],["and","OUT"],["incidence of postoperative haemorrhage and vomiting","OUT"],["diclofenac paracetamol","INT"],["and a","PAR"],["swallowing - evoked pain","OUT"],["serious adverse events","OUT"],["doses of postoperative analgesia","OUT"],["adolescent ( 16 - year - old girl )","PAR"],["children","PAR"],["vt and total plasma clearance elimination half - life","OUT"],["ketamine","INT"],["pain scale need for morphine","OUT"],["pain","OUT"],["remifentanil","INT"],["halothane","INT"],["rate of recovery","OUT"],["rectal diclofenac","INT"],["glycopyrrolate","INT"],["time to awaken from anaesthesia or incidence of postoperative vomiting","OUT"],[" pain scores in recovery and pain scores","OUT"],["laparoscopy","INT"],["sevoflurane","INT"],["postoperative analgesia","OUT"],["efficacy","OUT"],["diclofenac - paracetamol combination","INT"],["morphine","INT"],["analgesic effect","OUT"],["adverse effects and duration of pca","OUT"],["analgesia","OUT"],["diclofenac acetaminophen","INT"],["nsaid","INT"],["discomfort","OUT"],["diclofenac","INT"],["sedation score sedation scores","OUT"],["children after inguinal herniotomy or orchidopexy","PAR"],["dysplastic kidney with ectopic ureter","PAR"],["s ( + ) - ketamine bupivacaine","INT"],["opioid","INT"],["children anaesthetized with","PAR"],["colon perforation","OUT"],["analgesic activity adverse reactions","OUT"],["voltarol paracetamol","INT"],["reactionary haemorrhage","OUT"],["scores for salivation","OUT"],["diclofenac papaveretum","INT"],["children who received an analgesic regimen combining an","PAR"],["children undergoing ophthalmological surgery","PAR"],["median pain scores","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of analgesics for children undergoing surgery.

More information is required to confirm efficacy in postsurgical pain. AZD3582 750 mg had similar analgesic efficacy as equimolar doses of naproxen, but noninferiority to rofecoxib was not demonstrated. Patients treated with a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg achieved an overall analgesic effect at least as effective as patients treated with a single-dose of oxycodone\/acetaminophen 10\/650 mg over 6 h and multidose oxycodone\/acetaminophen over 24 h, with fewer adverse experiences of nausea (p < 0.001), vomiting (p < 0.01), and dizziness (p < 0.001). Rofecoxib provided superior analgesic efficacy compared with codeine\/acetaminophen with fewer gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events. These results support the hypothesis that the analgesic effects of NSAIDs primarily derive from inhibition of COX-2. In this study of moderate to severe postoperative dental pain, the analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was greater than that of codeine\/acetaminophen, with a lower incidence of adverse events and nausea. Compared with 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (50 mg every 8 hours), a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg provided greater overall analgesic efficacy over 24 hours. Rofecoxib 50 mg once daily effectively treated post-orthopedic surgery pain. Rofecoxib has a longer duration of action as a single dose and gave adequate analgesia for over half of that study group; patients in the dexketoprofen trometamol group needed more rescue analgesia. The overall analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was generally similar to that of ibuprofen 400 mg, except for a significantly longer duration of analgesic effect. Lumiracoxib 400 mg provides rapid, effective and sustained relief of post-operative dental pain, comparable or superior to rofecoxib. This study demonstrates that valdecoxib provides significantly greater analgesic efficacy than rofecoxib in the management of pain after oral surgery. The limited efficacy of rofecoxib in this study contrasts to the results of previous surgical studies evaluating rofecoxib, and may be partially explained by the postoperative dosing in this arthroscopic surgical model. We concluded that rofecoxib was efficacious in the treatment of postoperative dental pain and that COX-2-derived prostanoids play a role in treatment of the pain associated with dental surgery. All study medications were generally well tolerated. Thus rofecoxib provided analgesic efficacy superior to that of celecoxib and comparable to that of ibuprofen in the treatment of patients with acute postoperative dental pain. Whether this is relevant for short-term use is unknown, but it has to be considered before rofecoxib may be used for pain relief following third molar surgery. All active treatments were well tolerated.

These results suggest that prone position is a safe and beneficial procedure during weaning from mechanical ventilation and may contribute to weaning success in preterm infants. The prone position could decrease energy expenditure for spontaneous breathing and may shorten the period of ventilatory support for very low birthweight infants with CLD. We conclude that placing the stable VLBW mechanically ventilated infant in a side-lying position has no deleterious effects on oxygenation and ventilation, as measured by tcPO2 and tcPCO2, and therefore should be encouraged. This may conserve energy and decrease complications of hypoxia for sick preterm infants. This suggest that short-term lateral positioning as well as supine positioning can be utilized without deleterious effects on pulmonary mechanics and gas exchange in neonates recovering from respiratory distress syndrome. The mechanism and clinical applicability of such observations need to be explored further. We conclude that oxygenation in infants with unilateral lung disease is best with the good lung uppermost--the reverse of what has been observed in adults.

Furthermore, hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) may influence somatometric GH correlation patterns too. It also shows that low-dose vitamin D supplementation has only a minor effect in the prevention of osteoporosis in non-osteoporotic early postmenopausal women and does not give any benefit additional to that of HRT alone. Physical fitness levels increased in the exercise groups, but not in the control group or the estrogen-alone treated women. Provera does not adversely affect the lipid profile. These findings show that all three treatments are effective in the prevention of postmenopausal loss of bone mass. Plasma fasting homocysteine concentrations are lowered by E2-dydrogesterone therapy in postmenopausal women. This observation provides important insights into the metabolic effects of postmenopausal hormones but is insufficient to recommend the use of hormones for secondary prevention of heart disease. This 4-year randomized study showed an additive effect of etidronate and HRT on hip and spine BMD in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. The possible dyslipidemic effect of cholecalciferol, along with the risk of hypercalcemia, emphasizes the caution necessary in cholecalciferol treatment. The present study suggests that high-dose post-menopausal hormone therapy changes the body composition by increasing the muscle mass and that, since the body weight remains unchanged, a proportionate decrease in the fat mass seems to occur. HRT is effective in reducing elevated LDL cholesterol levels, and should be considered in the treatment of hyperlipidaemic postmenopausal women, in addition to dietary therapy. Hormone replacement therapy did not increase muscle performance, improve balance or reduce falls over a year in middle-aged women. This is the first study to demonstrate the effects of etidronate in early postmenopausal women, and the additive beneficial effects of HRT and ICE on bone mineral density. Moreover, the low frequency of bleeding with continuous oestrogen-progestogen therapy would make this an appropriate alternative in postmenopausal replacement therapy. Total serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were reduced by approximately 5% (P less than 0.01) and 8% (P less than 0.01), respectively, after 1 year of combined oestrogen-CPA therapy in comparison with both the initial values and the placebo group but serum triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol levels were unchanged in both groups. It is concluded that treatment with sequentially combined oestrogen and progestogen, using norethisterone acetate in combination with 17 beta-oestradiol in clinically relevant doses, does not produce any adverse effects on serum lipids or lipoproteins. Menopause is associated with a gain in fat mass and a loss of lean body mass, but these changes in body composition are not prevented by hormone replacement therapy. None of these factors significantly affected the observed overall relationships between estrogen and changes in girth. In conclusion, both regimens produce a clinically relevant decrease of fibrinogen levels; the continuous regimen affects also the levels of FVII and inhibitors suggesting that the haemostatic balance is shifted to a more physiological state. The findings of the present study suggest that some of the protective impact of postmenopausal hormone therapy on cardiovascular disease may be explained by the effect on body composition, in particular abdominal fat. The overall effect of NA-EE2 treatments on lipid measures was favorable. Our study provides conclusive evidence that hormone treatment does not produce weight gain in women during the menopause transition. This study demonstrates that this estradiol matrix transdermal delivery system is effective in the treatment of menopausal symptoms, while providing the skin tolerability desired by patients. The paradoxical changes of triglyceride and HDL might partly be explained by the effect of progestins used in this study. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9232488275,"bertscore_r":0.8522599339,"bertscore_f":0.8863352537,"rouge1_p":0.625,"rouge1_r":0.2631578947,"rouge1_f":0.3703703704,"rouge2_p":0.2666666667,"rouge2_r":0.1081081081,"rouge2_f":0.1538461538,"rougeL_p":0.4375,"rougeL_r":0.1842105263,"rougeL_f":0.2592592593,"rougeLsum_p":0.4375,"rougeLsum_r":0.1842105263,"rougeLsum_f":0.2592592593,"ei_score":0.9749306509,"claimver":0.6209096909,"sts":0.5421837568,"nli":0.5702489614},"entities":[["lipid profile","OUT"],["postmenopausal hormone therapy","INT"],["hrt ice","INT"],["e2 - dydrogesterone therapy","INT"],["early postmenopausal women","PAR"],["lipid measures","OUT"],["bone mineral density","OUT"],["hip and spine bmd","OUT"],["weight gain","OUT"],["muscle performance improve balance reduce falls","OUT"],["postmenopausal loss of bone mass","OUT"],["total serum cholesterol and ldl - cholesterol","OUT"],["osteoporosis","OUT"],["postmenopausal women","PAR"],["etidronate","INT"],["estradiol matrix","INT"],["fibrinogen levels levels of fvii and inhibitors","OUT"],["oestrogen progestogen norethisterone acetate 17 beta - oestradiol","INT"],["body composition muscle mass fat mass","OUT"],["tolerability","OUT"],["frequency bleeding","OUT"],["oestrogen - cpa placebo","INT"],["hormone replacement therapy","INT"],["hormonal replacement therapy ( hrt )","INT"],["physical fitness levels","OUT"],["na - ee2","INT"],["non - osteoporotic early postmenopausal women","PAR"],["elevated ldl cholesterol levels","OUT"],["middle - aged women","PAR"],["estrogen changes in girth","OUT"],["triglyceride and hdl","OUT"],["etidronate and hrt","INT"],["hormone therapy","INT"],["postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis","PAR"],["oestrogen progestogen","INT"],["serum lipids or lipoproteins","OUT"],["provera","INT"],["hrt","INT"],["vitamin d supplementation","INT"],["serum triglycerides and hdl - cholesterol levels","OUT"],["cholecalciferol cholecalciferol","INT"],["fat mass lean body mass","OUT"],["women during the menopause transition","PAR"],["plasma fasting homocysteine concentrations","OUT"],["hyperlipidaemic postmenopausal women","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of estrogen replacement therapy for the prevention of osteoporosis.

Using lidocaine to inflate the ETT cuff decreases the severity of postoperative sore throat at one hour, and both the incidence and severity at 24 hours. This approach also decreases hemodynamic effects, restlessness, dysphonia, and hoarseness. There were no significant differences between the two groups, which suggests that topical anaesthesia of the mucosa of the upper airway is ineffective as a means of ameliorating airway complaints in connection with tracheal intubation. These data show benefits of using an alkalinized lidocaine-filled ETT cuff in combination with water-soluble gel lubrication in preventing post-intubation sore throat. A decrease in sore throat during the postoperative period was recorded when the cuff was inflated with a small dose of alkalinized lidocaine (i.e., 40 mg of L-HCl and 1.4% of NaHCO3) rather than with air when ventilation was controlled without N2O. Our findings also confirm that laryngo-tracheal lidocaine application does not prevent sore throat, hoarseness or dysphagia after total intravenous anaesthesia. Lidocaine was also effective in reducing of incidence and severity of sore throat after operation. The complications were more in the air group. In conclusion, intravenous lidocaine prior to endotracheal intubation decreased the incidence of postoperative sore throat and cough. Lidocaine, saline, and air had similar effects on postoperative sore throat. Thus, alkalinized lidocaine-filled ET cuffs seem to be safer than conventional air-filled ET cuffs. Using lidocaine to inflate the ETT cuff or IV lidocaine at the end of surgery decreases the frequency of postoperative cough and sore throat and would provide better outcome for patients and the physician.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8668313026,"bertscore_r":0.8465824127,"bertscore_f":0.8565872312,"rouge1_p":0.2380952381,"rouge1_r":0.0980392157,"rouge1_f":0.1388888889,"rouge2_p":0.1,"rouge2_r":0.04,"rouge2_f":0.0571428571,"rougeL_p":0.1904761905,"rougeL_r":0.0784313725,"rougeL_f":0.1111111111,"rougeLsum_p":0.1904761905,"rougeLsum_r":0.0784313725,"rougeLsum_f":0.1111111111,"ei_score":0.9681421731,"claimver":0.7299742103,"sts":0.4909476042,"nli":0.5466405749},"entities":[["post - operative side - effects","OUT"],["##nized lidocaine - filled ett cuff","INT"],["complications","OUT"],["sore throat, hoarseness or dysphagia","OUT"],["post intubation sore throat","OUT"],["lidocaine - filled et","INT"],["incidence of postoperative sore throat and cough","OUT"],["lignocaine jelly","INT"],["alkalized lidocaine lidocaine","INT"],["postoperative sore throat","OUT"],["incidence and severity of sore throat","OUT"],["frequency of postoperative cough and sore throat","OUT"],["sore throat","OUT"],["lidocaine, saline air","INT"],["severity of postoperative sore throat severity","OUT"],["hemodynamic effects, restlessness, dysphonia, and hoarseness","OUT"],["lidocaine","INT"],["lidocaine lidocaine","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of lidocaine to prevent postoperative sore throat.

Alvimopan (6 or 12 mg) accelerates GI recovery and is well tolerated in patients undergoing open laparotomy. The results show that the naloxone formulation counteracts the effect of codeine on intestinal transit, suggesting that it may have useful clinical applications. Oral methylnaltrexone may have a clinical value in the prevention and treatment of constipation induced by long-term opioid use. However, opioid withdrawal was observed and it is suggested that initial individual naloxone doses should not exceed 5 mg. Further research is needed into the oral absorption of naloxone, as well as further studies of clinical efficacy and dosing. Methylnaltrexone may be a useful adjunct to opioids for the relief of opioid-induced constipation. Alvimopan has a safety profile that is similar to that of placebo and provides significantly improved lower gastrointestinal recovery in women who undergo simple total abdominal hysterectomy. Alvimopan, a novel peripheral opioid mu-receptor antagonist, has demonstrated significant efficacy for the management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction without compromise of centrally mediated opioid-induced analgesia. Delayed gastrointestinal transit after nalbuphine is explained by agonist-like effects on peripheral opioid receptors in the gut. In patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, alvimopan accelerated gastrointestinal recovery and time to the hospital discharge order written compared with placebo and was well tolerated. Low-dosage methylnaltrexone may have clinical utility in managing opioid-induced constipation. Our results suggest that there is a prevailing direct and local luminal effect of enteric-coated methylnaltrexone and that the enteric-coated formulation exerts its gut pharmacologic actions more efficiently than the uncoated formulation. Our results provide evidence that the administration of enteral opioid antagonists in ventilated patients with opioid analgesia might be a simple-and possibly preventive-treatment of increased gastric tube reflux and reduces frequency of pneumonia. We conclude that ADL 8-2698 prevents morphine-induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affecting central opioid analgesia. Reduction of esophagogastral mucosal injury and reduced need for procinetic medication suggests an improvement of GI motility by enteral naloxone in fentanyl-treated, mechanically ventilated patients. Patients using high doses of opioids appear to be the most vulnerable to the analgesic effect of oral naloxone. Our results suggest that subcutaneous methylnaltrexone may have clinical utility in treating opioid-induced constipation and reducing opioid-induced unpleasant subjective symptoms. Alvimopan accelerated GI recovery and time to hospital discharge order written compared with placebo in patients undergoing laparotomy and was well tolerated. Epidural naloxone reduces epidural morphine-induced intestinal hypomotility without reversing its analgesic effects. Selective inhibition of gastrointestinal opioid receptors by an antagonist with limited oral absorption that does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier speeds recovery of bowel function and shortens the duration of hospitalization. Methylnaltrexone may have the potential to decrease the side effects of opioid medications, which are mediated peripherally, while maintaining the central analgesia effect of the opioid.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.833579421,"bertscore_r":0.8393589854,"bertscore_f":0.8364592791,"rouge1_p":0.1632653061,"rouge1_r":0.1975308642,"rouge1_f":0.1787709497,"rouge2_p":0.0309278351,"rouge2_r":0.0375,"rouge2_f":0.0338983051,"rougeL_p":0.1224489796,"rougeL_r":0.1481481481,"rougeL_f":0.1340782123,"rougeLsum_p":0.1224489796,"rougeLsum_r":0.1481481481,"rougeLsum_f":0.1340782123,"ei_score":0.01931844,"claimver":0.4012784362,"sts":0.5787984133,"nli":0.6147627831},"entities":[["esophagogastral mucosal injury need procinetic medication","OUT"],["patients using high of","PAR"],["colonic transit","OUT"],["patients undergoing laparotomy","PAR"],["alvimopan","INT"],["placebo","INT"],["fentanyl - treated, mechanically ventilated patients","PAR"],["adl 8 - 2698","INT"],["women who undergo simple total abdominal hysterectomy","PAR"],["opioid - induced unpleasant subjective symptoms","OUT"],["nalbuphine","INT"],["methylnaltrexone","INT"],["tolerated","OUT"],["alvimopan placebo","INT"],["opioid withdrawal","OUT"],["ventilated patients with opioid analgesia","PAR"],["gi recovery tolerated","OUT"],["hypomotility","OUT"],["bowel function","OUT"],["enteral opioid antagonists","INT"],["intestinal transit","OUT"],["lower gastrointestinal recovery","OUT"],["patients undergoing open laparotomy","PAR"],["patients undergoing major abdominal surgery","PAR"],["tube reflux frequency of pneumonia","OUT"],["naloxone","INT"],["gi recovery and time to hospital discharge order written","OUT"],["gastrointestinal recovery time to the hospital discharge order","OUT"],["analgesic","OUT"],["gastrointestinal transit time","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of opioids to reduce the duration of constipation.

It is concluded that tailored decision aids prepare women for decision making better than do general pamphlets. The preferences of patients with prostate cancer in the choice of treatment may differ from the priorities of the physicians. Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. However, factors other than provision of information must determine their CRC screening preferences. The results of this study have implications for future DA design, and other areas where patient Kn and understanding are important, such as in the setting of informed consent. A decision aid consisting of an educational video, brochure, and chart marker increased ordering and performance of colon cancer screening tests. Whether shared decision making is the ideal model and how to measure its occurrence are subjects for further research. Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The study suggests that well-informed women adopting an active role may counteract physicians' emphasis on newly introduced treatments. Overall, the video was significantly more effective than the Internet in educating participants about benefits and risks of PSA screening. Results are discussed in terms of contextual factors and individual differences as moderators of treatment decision aid effectiveness. Public Web sites about prostate cancer provide less effective decision support than a specially designed Internet decision aid. (c) 2008 American Cancer Society. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00345449). Despite the low overall vaccine acceptance rate, it is concluded that individualized decision analysis can influence the clinical decisions taken by knowledgeable and interested patients. Further research is required to ascertain the utility of the decision aid during the consultation. The results of this pilot study justify future large-scale trials to determine the effectiveness of similar interventions. Strategies to match these patients' needs might improve compliance and long-term outcomes. Delivery of decision aids by clinicians during the visit improves knowledge and shows a trend toward better acceptability and less decisional conflict. Also, preconsultation education appears to be an effective clinical strategy for helping patients gain an accurate understanding of their treatment options before meeting with physicians. Providing women with information alone did not affect treatment choices; however, the addition of an interview to clarify values and elicit preferences had a significant effect on women's management and resulted in reduced costs. Its impact on costs of care depends on the proportion of patients with various diagnoses and on local surgery rates. Efforts to broadly implement decision aids may need to offer a variety of approaches, and incorporate creative strategies to enhance reaching all population subgroups. There was short-term improvement in the appropriateness of antithrombotic care among patients with NVAF who were exposed to a decision aid, but the improvement did not persist. A PDA regarding the use of NHPs for menopausal symptoms impacted favourably on women's decisional conflict, but was not superior to a general information brochure on menopause. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc. These findings should be replicated in studies with a larger sample size and patients at overall higher risk of CHD. Incorporating the PSA videotape into the periodic health examination for asymptomatic men aged 50 years and older is recommended. This trial demonstrates that, among patients facing a real treatment decision, interventions to inform patients about hypertension and to clarify patients' values concerning outcomes of treatment are effective in reducing decisional conflict and increasing patient knowledge, while not resulting in any increases in state anxiety. Trial Registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN84367722. The next stage is to explore strategies to make it available to all appropriate patients. The decision aid is an effective and acceptable strategy for patient education to facilitate an inclusive and informed decision-making process about managing ovarian cancer risk. Such subgroups should be identified, and appropriate decision support interventions should be developed and evaluated. These findings suggest that theoretically designed interventions can be effective in helping women understand their cancer risk and appropriate risk assessment options and can be implemented successfully within a service program like the CIS. Further work needs to examine ways to enhance women's power in decision-making within the doctor-patient relationship. Compared to pamphlets, DAs appear to improve the agreement between women's and physicians' decisional conflict about HRT. The presentation of video images appears to be a valuable information source for conveying treatment options to patients, but caution may be needed to prevent elevated or possibly unrealistic treatment expectations. Decision aids may emerge as a useful tool to facilitate SDM and evidence-based clinical practice. Women made more informed decisions when provided with an evidence-based decision-aid leaflet preceding a routine consultation about choices of termination method. Further study is needed to specifically determine effects in those changing the status quo and on the quality of patient-practitioner communication and persistence with decisions. These results suggest that this computer program has the potential to stand alone as an educational intervention for low-risk women but should be used as a supplement to genetic counseling for those at high risk. Clinicaltrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00686062 I. Unique Protocol ID 211705 ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT 00148226. As barriers to implementing computer-based patient decision support programs decrease, alternative models for delivering these programs should be explored. Supporting decision making in a systematic way using trade-offs is beneficial for these women. The developed decision aid improved patient outcomes better than a control pamphlet when implemented during genetic counseling and given to the patient to take home. Decision aids are an effective decision-support strategy for women considering genetic testing for breast\/ovarian cancer risk, and are most effective before the patient has made a decision, which is generally at the point of having blood drawn. When making decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy, patients with early breast cancer who had been exposed to the Decision Board had better knowledge of the disease and treatment options and greater satisfaction with their decision making than those who received the standard consultation. The use of web based technology would reduce the cost of the intervention. Such instruments should be considered by surgeons when communicating the different surgical options to women with breast cancer. Such programmes could be delivered cheaply by the internet, and there are good arguments for coordinated investment in them, particularly for conditions in which patient utilities are important. The six-step approach to decision making was more helpful than the SOGC's information document in increasing subjects' knowledge of the risks and benefits of HRT, in creating more realistic expectations of HRT, and in increasing the congruence between subjects' personal values and their decisions on HRT. The tendency for the decision choices and knowledge scores to return to baseline at follow-up suggests the need for initial and ongoing prevention decision support. As immunization schedules increase in complexity and parents are asked to make more choices, videotaped information may be a better method to achieve the goal of truly informed consent. Providing patients with balanced information may not be sufficient to alter the decision-making process. Colorectal Web is more effective than a standard colorectal cancer Web site at prompting previously unscreened individuals to choose a preferred colorectal cancer screening test and to be screened for colorectal cancer. For physicians who offer the PSA as a screening test, this finding highlights the importance of apprising patients of the associated benefits, burdens, and uncertainties and allowing them to participate in the screening decision. Women will adhere to their own plans, suggesting that consumer rather than provider plans may be the more appropriate gold standard for measuring adherence.

There was no significant effect on achieving maximum bone mass in young women. The present study suggests that the two COCs could exert a similar positive effect on bone turnover in young postadolescent women, without any significant and appreciable modification of BMD. DMPA-SC is an effective and well-tolerated contraceptive option, providing comparable efficacy and BMD safety to DMPA-IM. Our results suggest that estrogen supplementation is protective of bone in adolescent girls who receive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections. Since contraception with a pill containing the lowest estrogen dose is associated with the lowest incidence of side effects, these findings further suggest a pill containing 20 microg EE2 for young post-adolescent women would be the best choice. Results must be interpreted cautiously until it is determined whether these effects endure or are reversible. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. The findings suggest an increase in bone density during treatment with levonorgestrel and stable values during short-term administration of DMPA, in standard clinical doses for contraception. Prospective studies are required to determine the long-term effects of this continuous COC regimen. Women of 19-43 years of age using either one of the implants showed lower BMD at 18 months of use at the midshaft of the ulna, however, without a difference at the distal radius. Our study suggests that the skeletal effects of OC preparations may be influenced by progestogenic components in young women. Mesigyna proved to be a highly effective and low risk agent for premenopausal users. Both combined oral contraceptives exert a similar positive influence on bone turnover in young postadolescent women. Biochemical markers provided evidence for a reduced bone resorption. These data support the view that the likely cause of DMPA-associated bone loss is estrogen deficiency and demonstrate that it can be arrested by estrogen replacement therapy.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8936338425,"bertscore_r":0.8250628114,"bertscore_f":0.8579804301,"rouge1_p":0.8,"rouge1_r":0.1012658228,"rouge1_f":0.1797752809,"rouge2_p":0.2105263158,"rouge2_r":0.025477707,"rouge2_f":0.0454545455,"rougeL_p":0.6,"rougeL_r":0.0759493671,"rougeL_f":0.1348314607,"rougeLsum_p":0.75,"rougeLsum_r":0.0949367089,"rougeLsum_f":0.1685393258,"ei_score":0.0115916578,"claimver":0.7610749006,"sts":0.5879901648,"nli":0.507587254},"entities":[["adolescent girls who receive depot","PAR"],["women","PAR"],["bmd","OUT"],["bone turnover","OUT"],["efficacy bmd safety","OUT"],["bone density","OUT"],["medroxyprogesterone acetate","INT"],["ee2","INT"],["young postadolescent women","PAR"],["dmpa - sc","INT"],["bone turnover and bone - sparing effect","OUT"],["women of 19 - 43 years of age","PAR"],["oral contraceptives","INT"],["estrogen supplementation","INT"],["mesigyna","INT"],["young women","PAR"],["maximum bone mass","OUT"],["young post - adolescent women","PAR"],["bone resorption","OUT"],["levonorgestrel dmpa","INT"],["injections","PAR"],["premenopausal users","PAR"],["bone loss","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of contraceptive implants in women.

This study, the first randomised controlled trial of its type, provides evidence that effective treatment of hyperlipidaemia favourably influences the natural history of symptomatic peripheral atherosclerosis. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Bezafibrate has no effect on the incidence of coronary heart disease and of stroke combined but may reduce the incidence of non-fatal coronary events, particularly in those aged <65 years at entry, in whom all coronary events may also be reduced. Compared with the fifteen control patients (treated with placebo), the fifteen patients treated with Sulodexide showed a significant decrease in blood triglycerides and fibrinogen as well as a significantly increased HDL-cholesterol, and positive instrumental changes: at the end of treatment Peak and Rest Flow values--and consequently also Winsor's index--were significantly increased only in patients treated with Sulodexide.

Our findings do not support the use of pyridoxine for treating carpal tunnel syndrome. The use of a magnet for reducing pain attributed to carpal tunnel syndrome was no more effective than use of the placebo device. Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd. This study provides added scientific evidence to support the efficacy of neutral wrist splints in CTS and suggests that physiologic improvement is best with full-time splint wear instructions. The results also indicate that the results of the electromyography\/nerve conduction study (EMG\/NCS) do not provide information about the subjects' likely response to splinting. Findings need to be confirmed, and ultrasound treatment will have to be compared with standard conservative and invasive treatment options. In this preliminary study, a yoga-based regimen was more effective than wrist splinting or no treatment in relieving some symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. There was no corresponding improvement in hand function or median nerve latency. These results provide evidence that keyboard users may experience a reduction in hand pain after several months of use of some alternative geometry keyboards. This study suggests that local insulin treatment may be of great potential benefit in the improvement of nerve functions in NIDDM patients with mild-to-moderate CTS who opt for conservative treatment. Although there was no statistically significant before-after difference in electrophysiologic studies, slightly decreased motor nerve conduction velocity and increased motor distal latency were noted in groups A and B, but not in group C. Ultrasound therapy in CTS was comparable to placebo ultrasound in providing symptomatic relief, and the probability of a negative effect on motor nerve conduction needs to be considered. For patients with mild to moderate CTS who opt for conservative treatment, corticosteroids are of greater benefit. This study also suggests that repeat electrodiagnostic testing is no more useful than clinical symptoms in deciding on surgical intervention after unsuccessful conservative therapy. Carpal tunnel syndrome associated with median nerve demyelination but not axonal degeneration may be treated with commonly used components of conservative medical or chiropractic care. This approach may provide a treatment alternative in the short-term, conservative management of CTS.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8688158393,"bertscore_r":0.8586747646,"bertscore_f":0.8637154698,"rouge1_p":0.2857142857,"rouge1_r":0.1333333333,"rouge1_f":0.1818181818,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.1904761905,"rougeL_r":0.0888888889,"rougeL_f":0.1212121212,"rougeLsum_p":0.1904761905,"rougeLsum_r":0.0888888889,"rougeLsum_f":0.1212121212,"ei_score":0.2865510618,"claimver":0.5798683763,"sts":0.5043506622,"nli":0.481495738},"entities":[["hand pain","OUT"],["placebo","INT"],["neutral wrist splints","INT"],["yoga - based regimen wrist splinting no","INT"],["niddm patients with mild - to - moderate cts who opt for conservative treatment","PAR"],["electromyography \/ nerve conduction study ( emg \/ ncs )","OUT"],["chiropractic care","INT"],["motor nerve conduction velocity increased motor distal latency","OUT"],["corticosteroids","INT"],["pain","OUT"],["patients with mild to moderate cts","PAR"],["magnet","INT"],["pyridoxine","INT"],["carpal tunnel","OUT"],["hand function or median nerve latency","OUT"],["nerve functions","OUT"],["insulin","INT"],["tendon gliding exercises","INT"],["ultrasound therapy placebo ultrasound","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific treatment for the majority of patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome.

Systemic prophylactic antibiotics can successfully reduce septic complications after appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis, and a single drug (cefamandole) directed at the facultative pathogens is as effective as double drug therapy, which includes specific anaerobic coverage. No further improvement could be demonstrated if cefuroxime against aerobic organisms was added. No untoward effects were observed. We conclude that there is no place for a single preoperative dosage of cefamandole in the management of appendicitis. They suggest that such antibiotic use be reserved for those suspected of having more serious disease. The postoperative wound infection rate is insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of metronidazole for prophylaxis in nonperforated acute appendicitis, although there appears to be a tendency of to assume its efficacy in this regard. The conclusion of this study is that a combination of an antibiotic aimed at aerobes (cefazolin or tobramycin) with another aiming at anaerobes (metronidazole) is the best prophylactic regime against post-appendicectomy sepsis. No significant difference was found in the incidence of complications between the treated and a control group, raising doubts as to whether this substance is of value when used intraperitoneally in peritonitis. The policy of antibiotic prophylaxis in emergency surgery seems to be of particular benefit in elderly patients. This work supports the value of metronidazole but suggests that a single-dose regimen is adequate for prophylaxis. Five patients with intra-abdominal infections caused by non-clostridial anaerobes were successfully treated with metronidazole. This study supports the already accepted value of metronidazole but suggests that a single intra-rectal dose regimen is adequate for prophylaxis. Tinidazole appears to be well suited to the prophylaxis of post-appendicectomy infections. Systemic antibiotic therapy can successfully reduce the complications following appendicectomy but it is necessary to use a compound with activity against anaerobic organisms. It is suggested that intra-rectal metronidazole, when used exclusively, is not sufficient for effective prophylaxis for appendicitis in childhood. No toxic effects of the antibiotics were detected, no anaesthetic complication occurred, and resistant strains of bacteria normally sensitive to the antibiotics were not isolated from wounds. It is concluded that a single peroperative parenteral dose of antibiotics does not constitute an entirely satisfactory means of wound infection prophylaxis in digestive surgery. It is suggested that an antibiotic which is effective against both aerobic and anaerobic organisms might have an advantage over metronidazole in appendicitis. It is recommended that all patients undergoing surgery for NPA be given 1 d of antibiotic prophylaxis. On the basis of these results the authors recommend that all patients subjected to an appendicectomy be given an intravenous tinidazole prophylaxis. Consequently, routine preoperative prophylaxis is recommended before appendectomy. We conclude that anaerobic organisms are more important than faecal aerobic organisms in the pathogenesis of wound infection after appendicectomy. The study showed that a combination of metronidazole and cotrimoxazole is a regime highly effective for prophylaxis against wound infection following appendicectomy. Predisposing factors for wound infection are leucocytosis greater than 12 000, anamnesis greater than 24 hours, operation time greater than 45 minutes. This study suggests that a single intra-operative dose of metronidazole dose not reduce the incidence of postoperative wound infection following appendicectomy for acute mural appendicitis. If the clinical and economic benefits of metronidazole shown by this study are confirmed, the drug should be considered for routine use in emergency appendicectomy. Septic morbidity after appendectomy for nonperforating appendicitis is significantly reduced by systemic antibiotics, and brief administration of a single broad-spectrum agent (cefoxitin) is effective prophylaxis. Our results give no clear indication of the benefit of metronidazole prophylaxis and we propose, therefore, to concentrate on the technical aspects of appendicectomy in infection prophylaxis. The use of metronidazole in prevention of wound infection is recommended. Although the need for antibiotic prophylaxis is well documented in adults, the rarity of infectious complications makes it highly questionable in the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis in children. In those receiving both drugs the infection rate was 3%, a highly significant difference from that in the other three groups.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8596350551,"bertscore_r":0.8302811384,"bertscore_f":0.8447031975,"rouge1_p":0.2941176471,"rouge1_r":0.0694444444,"rouge1_f":0.1123595506,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.2941176471,"rougeL_r":0.0694444444,"rougeL_f":0.1123595506,"rougeLsum_p":0.2941176471,"rougeLsum_r":0.0694444444,"rougeLsum_f":0.1123595506,"ei_score":0.9681608191,"claimver":0.3747310638,"sts":0.3861280382,"nli":0.5347830057},"entities":[["childhood","PAR"],["five patients with intra - abdominal infections caused by non - clostridial anaerobes","PAR"],["nonperforating appendicitis","PAR"],["elderly patients","PAR"],["systemic antibiotic therapy","INT"],["metronidazole","INT"],["patients subjected to an appendicectomy","PAR"],["patients undergoing surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis","PAR"],["postoperative wound infection rate","OUT"],["infection rate","OUT"],["metronidazole and cotrimoxazole","INT"],["incidence of complications","OUT"],["cefuroxime","INT"],["tinidazole","INT"],["cephaloridine","INT"],["septic morbidity","OUT"],["tinidazole prophylaxis","INT"],["( cefazolin or tobramycin ) ( metronidazole )","INT"],["toxic effects anaesthetic complication","OUT"],["( cefamandole )","INT"],["prophylactic antibiotics","INT"],["nonperforated","PAR"],["untoward effects","OUT"],["antibiotics","INT"],["rate of postoperative wound infection","OUT"],["wound infection","OUT"],["patients undergoing surgery for npa","PAR"],["postoperative wound infection","OUT"],["antibiotic prophylaxis","INT"],["( cefoxitin )","INT"],["septic","OUT"],["cefamandole","INT"],["in children","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in the management of acute appendicitis.

Further studies will be needed to define the role of bisphosphonates such as clodronate in this situation, in comparison with established treatments such as radiotherapy and analgesics. This dose is well tolerated and may promote bone repair, as judged by increases in bone alkaline phosphatase levels. We conclude from these results that CI2MDP could be of use in preventing the bone loss that occurs in multiple myeloma. The optimal dose and duration of effect require further evaluation, particularly in patients with stable disease and persistent bone pain. With the dose scheme used in this study sodium etidronate was ineffective for palliation of bone pain from prostatic cancer. Our preliminary findings suggest that Cl2MDP is safe, and has analgesic properties that may prove to be useful in the management of metastatic bone pain. In conclusion, low dose (800 mg\/d) oral clodronate seems to be as effective as standard dose (1600 mg\/d) in palliation of bone pain secondary to BM. The new bone resorption markers of collagen breakdown were able to predict clinical response to pamidronate. The overall negative result of the study is attributed to the very low absorption of orally administered bisphosphonates in general. The results do not support the superiority of combined intravenous and oral treatment with clodronate compared with oral administration only. No significant differences were seen in median survival or survival rates between the groups. In conclusion, our results seem to confirm the utility of higher doses of pamidronate in patients with painful bone metastases, because of the faster symptom relief achieved. The drug delays osteolytic bone lesions, reduces the degree of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria, and decreases pain. We conclude that intravenous pamidronate is well tolerated, significantly prolongs time to progressive bone disease, and significantly improves bone pain in patients with osteolytic metastases from breast cancer. We conclude that EHDP therapy used in this dosage schedule does not have a clinically significant impact in multiple myeloma. Though we found no clinical, biological and radiological difference with placebo, etidronate inhibited the increased bone resorption in multiple myeloma. We conclude that oral dichloromethylene diphosphonate can significantly inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone destruction in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer. Pamidronate 90 mg every 3 weeks results in higher bone remineralization, but this difference did not translate into a further increase of palliative effects. Intravenous pamidronate is a well tolerated treatment that produced significant relief of bone pain in the majority of patients with metastatic breast cancer at the three highest doses tested. Tolerance was excellent: only a few patients complained of pain at the intramuscular drug injection site. With these limits, oral clodronate demonstrated some efficacy in symptom control and in reducing the need for analgesics. Monthly infusions of pamidronate provide significant protection against skeletal complications and improve the quality of life of patients with stage III multiple myeloma. Monthly infusions of pamidronate as a supplement to chemotherapy can protect against skeletal complications in women with stage IV breast cancer who have osteolytic bone metastases. Our data indicate that if clodronate is to be used for the alleviation of bone pain in prostate cancer, patients with high baseline should be selected and high intravenous doses should be given at start of the treatment. Further research on dose and mode of treatment is mandatory. The poor tolerability of oral pamidronate coupled with the modest clinical effects reported here suggest that oral pamidronate will not replace the current strategy of regular intravenous infusions of pamidronate for the treatment of osteolytic bone disease.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8745493293,"bertscore_r":0.8626806736,"bertscore_f":0.8685744405,"rouge1_p":0.1481481481,"rouge1_r":0.1538461538,"rouge1_f":0.1509433962,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.1481481481,"rougeL_r":0.1538461538,"rougeL_f":0.1509433962,"rougeLsum_p":0.1481481481,"rougeLsum_r":0.1538461538,"rougeLsum_f":0.1509433962,"ei_score":0.2570102067,"claimver":0.8235068917,"sts":0.5579384565,"nli":0.5807697773},"entities":[["patients with osteolytic metastases from breast cancer","PAR"],["bone pain","OUT"],["patients with stable disease and bone","PAR"],["pamidronate","INT"],["patients with stage iii multiple myeloma","PAR"],["symptom","OUT"],["sodium etidronate","INT"],["osteoclast - mediated bone destruction","OUT"],["clodronate","INT"],["bone resorption markers of collagen breakdown","OUT"],["ci2mdp","INT"],["ehdp","INT"],["osteolytic bone lesions degree of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria pain","OUT"],["patients with bone metastases from breast cancer","PAR"],["pamidronate chemotherapy","INT"],["skeletal morbidity","OUT"],["tolerability","OUT"],["bone repair bone alkaline phosphatase levels","OUT"],["bone resorption","OUT"],["pamidronate pamidronate pamidronate","INT"],["women with stage iv breast cancer who have osteolytic bone metastases","PAR"],["median survival or survival rates","OUT"],["cl2mdp","INT"],["dichloromethylene diphosphonate","INT"],["symptom control need for analgesics","OUT"],["skeletal complications quality of life","OUT"],["placebo etidronate","INT"],["bone remineralization palliative effects","OUT"],["patients with painful bone metastases","PAR"],["tolerance pain intramuscular drug injection","OUT"],["bone loss","OUT"],["patients with metastatic breast cancer","PAR"],["time to progressive bone disease bone pain","OUT"],["analgesic","OUT"],["prostate","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of bisphosphonates for the treatment of pain in patients with metastatic bone disease.

Neither does the review indicate any causes for concern that PAN is more harmful than the benzodiazepines. Clinicians wishing to use PAN may initially wish to do so within trial settings. Further high quality trials should be done to confirm these findings and to investigate whether the PAN therapy has fewer adverse effects than other treatments for the alcohol withdrawal states. Studies to investigate the possible cost-effectiveness of PAN by reducing costly hospital admissions and decreasing post administration supervision also need to be performed.","predictions":[{"exp_short":"SPNXTA","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of alcoholic withdrawal.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8708027005,"bertscore_r":0.8357687593,"bertscore_f":0.8529261351,"rouge1_p":0.3888888889,"rouge1_r":0.1489361702,"rouge1_f":0.2153846154,"rouge2_p":0.0588235294,"rouge2_r":0.0217391304,"rouge2_f":0.0317460317,"rougeL_p":0.2222222222,"rougeL_r":0.085106383,"rougeL_f":0.1230769231,"rougeLsum_p":0.2222222222,"rougeLsum_r":0.085106383,"rougeLsum_f":0.1230769231,"ei_score":0.9574287436,"claimver":0.6592109203,"sts":0.4793164134,"nli":0.6076433063},"entities":[["alcoholic withdrawal","PAR"],["benzodiazepines","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"6GBRY0","prediction":"Our work provides further support for previous findings that show that PAN is a safe, rapid, and effective therapy for acute mild to moderately severe withdrawal states.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8611434102,"bertscore_r":0.8366986513,"bertscore_f":0.8487449884,"rouge1_p":0.3157894737,"rouge1_r":0.1276595745,"rouge1_f":0.1818181818,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.2105263158,"rougeL_r":0.085106383,"rougeL_f":0.1212121212,"rougeLsum_p":0.2105263158,"rougeLsum_r":0.085106383,"rougeLsum_f":0.1212121212,"ei_score":0.5079751229,"claimver":0.7592114806,"sts":0.5594710112,"nli":0.613833189},"entities":[["pan","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of nitrous oxide as a pharmacological treatment for acute alcohol withdrawal.

The nurse-led unit seemed to be a safe alternative to conventional management, but a full accounting of such units' place in the local continuum of care and the costs associated with acute hospitals managing post-acute patients is needed if nurse-led units are to become an effective part of the government's recent commitment to intermediate care.

There was no statistically significant difference between lisinopril 40 mg once daily and lisinopril 20 mg in combination with candesartan 16 mg once daily in reducing systolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with diabetes. 2009 Massachusetts Medical Society Our results show that lisinopril does not increase the risk of hypoglycaemic events in IDDM. In adults with vascular disease but without macroalbuminuria, the effects of telmisartan on major renal outcomes were similar to those of placebo. Candesartan, 32 mg\/d, for 4.7 years did not prevent microalbuminuria in mainly normotensive patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Neither drug showed any negative side effects on fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and both maintain constant AERs. Although combination therapy reduces proteinuria to a greater extent than monotherapy, overall it worsens major renal outcomes. The clinical consequences of the insignificant differences in AER remain unclear. In conclusion, this study confirms the efficacy and safety of losartan as an antihypertensive drug in diabetic patients. The 3-fold difference in the incidence of side effects, although not statistically significant for the available sample size, may be clinically relevant. In the macroalbuminuric patients, the rate of deterioration in renal function was also attenuated by treatment with enalapril. Over a five-year follow-up period, intensive (approximately 128\/75 mm Hg) BP control in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients: (1) slowed the progression to incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy; (2) decreased the progression of diabetic retinopathy; and (3) diminished the incidence of stroke. However, the degree of BP control, with both cilazapril and amlodipine, can successfully delay the slope of GFR decline in hypertensive NIDDM patients with or without incipient nephropathy. Further research is needed to determine whether this treatment forestalls the development of overt nephropathy. Intensive BP control with valsartan to <120\/80 mm Hg in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes and normo- or microalbuminuria significantly decreased the progression of UAE and in some cases caused regression of UAE. We could not identify a BP threshold below which renal benefit is lost. These data suggest a protective effect of lisinopril against the development of microalbuminuria. The nephroprotective effects of ACE inhibitor treatment was not associated with the ACE genotype (II, ID, DD). Fosinopril and amlodipine had similar effects on biochemical measures, but the patients randomized to fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of major vascular events, compared with the patients randomized to amlodipine. ).","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8553173542,"bertscore_r":0.850787878,"bertscore_f":0.8530465961,"rouge1_p":0.2413793103,"rouge1_r":0.1320754717,"rouge1_f":0.1707317073,"rouge2_p":0.0357142857,"rouge2_r":0.0192307692,"rouge2_f":0.025,"rougeL_p":0.2068965517,"rougeL_r":0.1132075472,"rougeL_f":0.1463414634,"rougeLsum_p":0.2068965517,"rougeLsum_r":0.1132075472,"rougeLsum_f":0.1463414634,"ei_score":0.6201288067,"claimver":0.4657309055,"sts":0.5128180981,"nli":0.5723860264},"entities":[["fosinopril amlodipine","INT"],["lisinopril lisinopril candesartan","INT"],["nephroprotective effects","OUT"],["microalbuminuria","OUT"],["hypertensive niddm patients with or without incipient nephropathy","PAR"],["lisinopril","INT"],["placebo","INT"],["renal","OUT"],["cilazapril amlodipine","INT"],["fosinopril","INT"],["risk of major vascular events","OUT"],["side effects","OUT"],["losartan","INT"],["rate of deterioration in renal function","OUT"],["normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes and normo - or microalbuminuria","PAR"],["telmisartan","INT"],["side effects fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) levels aer","OUT"],["bp","OUT"],["progression of uae uae","OUT"],["blood pressure","OUT"],["proteinuria","OUT"],["diabetic patients","PAR"],["mainly normotensive patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes","PAR"],["ace inhibitor","INT"],["efficacy safety","OUT"],["hypoglycaemic events","OUT"],["amlodipine","INT"],["type 1 diabetes patients","PAR"],["biochemical measures","OUT"],["hg","INT"],["adults with vascular disease but without macroalbuminuria","PAR"],["enalapril","INT"],["hypertensive patients with diabetes","PAR"],["normotensive type 2 diabetic patients","PAR"],["incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy progression of diabetic retinopathy ; incidence of stroke","OUT"],["valsartan","INT"],["systolic blood pressure","OUT"],["of gfr decline","OUT"],["candesartan","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is no evidence that antihypertensive drugs reduce the risk of renal failure or mortality in people with type 1 diabetes.

Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to assess the effects of family therapy on other important outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, sleep, depression-like symptoms, and satisfaction with life.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.928737402,"bertscore_r":0.870498538,"bertscore_f":0.8986753821,"rouge1_p":0.6666666667,"rouge1_r":0.1408450704,"rouge1_f":0.2325581395,"rouge2_p":0.2142857143,"rouge2_r":0.0428571429,"rouge2_f":0.0714285714,"rougeL_p":0.5333333333,"rougeL_r":0.1126760563,"rougeL_f":0.1860465116,"rougeLsum_p":0.5333333333,"rougeLsum_r":0.1126760563,"rougeLsum_f":0.1860465116,"ei_score":0.3193971873,"claimver":0.8627349138,"sts":0.7665377855,"nli":0.7821918726},"entities":[["family therapy","INT"],["state","OUT"],["depression, anxiety, sleep, depression - like symptoms, and satisfaction with life","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"VNCH8M","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of family therapy for the treatment of depression.","annotations":[{"annot_id":1,"annot_task":"main","fluency":2,"population":2,"intervention":2,"outcome":null,"ed_target":-1,"ed_generated":-1,"strength_target":0,"strength_generated":0,"ed_agree":true,"strength_agree":true}],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8337293267,"bertscore_r":0.8612270951,"bertscore_f":0.8472551703,"rouge1_p":0.2592592593,"rouge1_r":0.3943661972,"rouge1_f":0.312849162,"rouge2_p":0.0280373832,"rouge2_r":0.0428571429,"rouge2_f":0.0338983051,"rougeL_p":0.1296296296,"rougeL_r":0.1971830986,"rougeL_f":0.156424581,"rougeLsum_p":0.1296296296,"rougeLsum_r":0.1971830986,"rougeLsum_f":0.156424581,"ei_score":0.2193808912,"claimver":0.6401885152,"sts":0.6242154241,"nli":0.6983463764},"entities":[["family therapy","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"5VR9DD","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of family therapy as adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for patients with major affective disorder","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9009584188,"bertscore_r":0.8679481745,"bertscore_f":0.8841453195,"rouge1_p":0.6904761905,"rouge1_r":0.4084507042,"rouge1_f":0.5132743363,"rouge2_p":0.2926829268,"rouge2_r":0.1714285714,"rouge2_f":0.2162162162,"rougeL_p":0.4285714286,"rougeL_r":0.2535211268,"rougeL_f":0.3185840708,"rougeLsum_p":0.4285714286,"rougeLsum_r":0.2535211268,"rougeLsum_f":0.3185840708,"ei_score":0.3206791835,"claimver":0.8563120365,"sts":0.7308447957,"nli":0.7894868851},"entities":[["family therapy","INT"],["patients with major affective disorder","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"JX1AJ6","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of family therapy as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for people with bipolar I disorder.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9029432535,"bertscore_r":0.8743778467,"bertscore_f":0.8884310126,"rouge1_p":0.619047619,"rouge1_r":0.1830985915,"rouge1_f":0.2826086957,"rouge2_p":0.2,"rouge2_r":0.0571428571,"rouge2_f":0.0888888889,"rougeL_p":0.4285714286,"rougeL_r":0.1267605634,"rougeL_f":0.1956521739,"rougeLsum_p":0.4285714286,"rougeLsum_r":0.1267605634,"rougeLsum_f":0.1956521739,"ei_score":0.3199979651,"claimver":0.9238370657,"sts":0.7961972356,"nli":0.8071039915},"entities":[["family therapy","INT"],["people with bipolar i disorder","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"PX7SGV","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of family therapy in the treatment of depressed adolescents.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.882619679,"bertscore_r":0.8919582367,"bertscore_f":0.8872643709,"rouge1_p":0.3854166667,"rouge1_r":0.5211267606,"rouge1_f":0.4431137725,"rouge2_p":0.0947368421,"rouge2_r":0.1285714286,"rouge2_f":0.1090909091,"rougeL_p":0.1875,"rougeL_r":0.2535211268,"rougeL_f":0.2155688623,"rougeLsum_p":0.1875,"rougeLsum_r":0.2535211268,"rougeLsum_f":0.2155688623,"ei_score":0.2718412493,"claimver":0.8123666048,"sts":0.8236442804,"nli":0.8739289045},"entities":[["family therapy","INT"],["depressed adolescents","PAR"]]}],"target_entities":[["family therapy","INT"]]}

Those receiving high feedback were more likely to report that they had acted on health advice given at the first antenatal visit to reduce their smoking and drinking. (P less than or equal to .05 for all findings.) I. Brief advice appears to be ineffective. In addition, this technique is inexpensive, readily accepted by staff, and efficient. A low cost health promotion program of telephone support during pregnancy can significantly improve a woman's psychosocial status during pregnancy. Good quality motivational interviewing did not significantly increase smoking cessation among pregnant women. An intervention of psychosocial support and health education during pregnancy failed to show any benefit on perinatal outcome, health-related behavior, or utilization of health facilities. Physician training on how to gain a pregnant smoker's commitment to change her smoking behavior, an office prompt system, and individualized smoking behavior change counseling show promise in reducing smoking during pregnancy and postpartum, but practical methods to assist pregnant smokers between regular prenatal visits, as they attempt to quit, need to be developed. There were no significant differences among the three groups for either the number who quit smoking or who reduced the number of cigarettes smoked. Health professionals should also support better-targeted public health campaigns and tobacco-control initiatives generally, because, undoubtedly, the social environment is a major determinant of initiation and continuation of smoking. The findings reinforce the importance of a whole population approach to tobacco control. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Achieving quit rates in WIC similar to those in studies conducted at prenatal care settings, suggests that smoking cessation programs for low-income pregnant WIC clients are feasible. Relapse prevention interventions may need to be increased in duration and potency to prevent post-partum relapse. These results indicate that the use of peer support may be an effective adjunct in smoking cessation programs for pregnant adolescents. This study suggests that the use of videotapes modeling smoking behavior change may increase the effectiveness of the assistance in quitting smoking that is generally available in obstetric and family practices or public maternity clinics. This programme is inexpensive, requires little extra effort, and does not need specially trained personnel. Education and support by midwives, as part of primary midwifery, can facilitate smoking cessation and reduction during pregnancy. Nicotine patches had no influence on smoking cessation during pregnancy, although they might increase birth weight in comparison with placebo. It was concluded that the intervention had either a small or no influence on cigarette smoking. '. Interventions extended into postpartum care did not affect relapse and smoking rates postdelivery. Special attention should be paid to the needs of heavier smokers. the intervention therefore helped to cut the number of cigarettes smoked. Given the negative outcomes associated with self-help materials and clinic-based counseling reported in this and other trials, alternative intervention strategies need to be developed and tested for this significant group of prepregnancy smokers. Other possible interpretations of the results, that maternal smoking is merely an index of some other factor that retards growth or that those counselled did not reduce their smoking sufficiently to influence outcome, cannot be excluded. Although adding individual smoking cessation counseling did not increase quitting rates during pregnancy, it should be considered for women in public maternity clinics because of its potential long-term effectiveness. The midwife-assisted smoking cessation intervention seems to be an effective tool to help pregnant smokers make a decision to quit smoking. Given also that the intervention was resource intensive, it is of doubtful benefit. Ultrasound screening does not reduce the frequency of smoking during pregnancy. The factors that contribute to the lack of a significant increase in smoking cessation in the intervention group and the possible explanation for the changes in birth-weight are discussed. While there was no effect of counselling on either serum thiocyanate or end expiratory carbon monoxide, the counselled group gained slightly more weight than controls during the study (0.47 vs. 0.44 kg per week among controls; NS), and their infants had modestly higher birthweight (44 g; NS). The findings suggest that some fetal growth retardation can be overcome by the provision of antismoking assistance to pregnant women. Improvements in the intervention and implementation issues are discussed. Achieving changes in smoking behavior in pregnant women with low-intensity interventions is difficult. An important precondition is that midwives need a proper training. More data are needed to determine safety parameters and to confirm the efficacy of NRT use during pregnancy. Current smoking cessation rates in pregnancy are very low. This intervention, implemented by clinic personnel as part of routine medical visits, was effective under these natural conditions across different types of clinic service. Point-of-care testing and feedback coupled with counselling can significantly reduce smoking during pregnancy and increase birthweight. A multimodal intervention regimen with initial individual counseling supplemented by an invitation to join a smoking cessation program with nicotine replacement therapy as a voluntary option markedly increased cessation rates during pregnancy. The use of overseas programs needs to be approached with caution. The shift was not maintained at the 36-week visit. These results provide further evidence that VBRT has a substantive contribution to make to efforts to decrease maternal smoking during pregnancy and provide new evidence of positive effects on fetal health. Many had tried to quit smoking at least once prior to pregnancy. Results of this trial indicate that health education methods tailored to the pregnant smoker are more effective in changing smoking behavior than the standard clinic information and advice to quit and\/or the use of smoking cessation methods not tailored to the needs of the pregnant smoker. We conclude that a low-cost prenatal self-help intervention can significantly affect the public health problem of smoking during pregnancy and its associated risks for maternal and child health. Infant birth weight increases with both smoking cessation and smoking reduction, suggesting that peer counseling intervention programs may improve newborn health despite their failure to affect smoking cessation. The differences in birthweight and length between the intervention and control groups were concentrated almost entirely among the first born infants who were 68 g heavier and 0.75 cm longer in the intervention group than the first born infants in the control group. Health education methods are efficacious and cost beneficial for pregnant smokers in public health maternity clinics. The magnitude of these treatment effects exceed levels typically observed with pregnant and recently postpartum smokers, and the maintenance of effects through 24 weeks postpartum extends the duration beyond those reported previously. Validated smoking cessation rates among pregnant women are substantially lower than the self reported rates on which current smoking policy is based. We conclude that smoking in pregnancy, being one of the few amenable to risk factors affecting the perinatal death statistics, demands an active smoking cessation program during pregnancy led by specially trained health professionals. We recorded a 10% quit rate in both intervention group and control group, and 42% and 31% reduced their smoking in the intervention group and control group, respectively. The resources invested are probably within the limits of the common pregnancy health care. The application of principles of organizational development and quality improvement at the management and clinical practice levels and the delivery of evidence-based health education methods by trained prenatal care providers significantly increased smoking cessation rates among pregnant Medicaid recipients.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8766006231,"bertscore_r":0.8661466241,"bertscore_f":0.8713422418,"rouge1_p":0.5454545455,"rouge1_r":0.1690140845,"rouge1_f":0.2580645161,"rouge2_p":0.1904761905,"rouge2_r":0.0571428571,"rouge2_f":0.0879120879,"rougeL_p":0.3636363636,"rougeL_r":0.1126760563,"rougeL_f":0.1720430108,"rougeLsum_p":0.3636363636,"rougeLsum_r":0.1126760563,"rougeLsum_f":0.1720430108,"ei_score":0.3108668636,"claimver":0.8020373583,"sts":0.7074417472,"nli":0.768258214},"entities":[["videotapes","INT"],["ultrasound screening","INT"],["self - help intervention","INT"],["health promotion program telephone support","INT"],["smoking cessation -","OUT"],["maternal smoking","OUT"],["placebo","INT"],["psychosocial support and health education","INT"],["birthweight and length","OUT"],["education midwives","INT"],["prepregnancy smokers","PAR"],["smoking","OUT"],["pregnant smokers","PAR"],["cigarette smoking","OUT"],["vbrt","INT"],["relapse and smoking rates","OUT"],["peer counseling intervention","INT"],["health education","INT"],["counseling","INT"],["smoking cessation rates","OUT"],["serum thiocyanate or end expiratory carbon monoxide weight birthweight","OUT"],["smoking cessation","OUT"],["quit rates","OUT"],["infant birth weight","OUT"],["smoking cessation counseling","INT"],["education","INT"],["quitting rates","OUT"],["antismoking","INT"],["cessation rates","OUT"],["pregnant medicaid recipients","PAR"],["low - income pregnant wic clients","PAR"],["pregnant women","PAR"],["fetal growth retardation","OUT"],["peer support","INT"],["smoking behavior change counseling","INT"],["smoking cessation birth weight","OUT"],["frequency smoking","OUT"],["pregnant smokers in public health maternity clinics","PAR"],["heavier smokers","PAR"],["pregnant adolescents","PAR"],["number who quit smoking or who reduced the number of cigarettes smoked","OUT"],["initial individual counseling supplemented invitation a smoking cessation program with nicotine replacement therapy","INT"],["quit rate smoking","OUT"],["health advice smoking and drinking","OUT"],["motivational interviewing","INT"],["nicotine patches","INT"],["women in public maternity clinics","PAR"],["health education methods","INT"],["midwife - assisted smoking cessation intervention","INT"],["smokers","PAR"],["smoking behavior","OUT"],["smoking birthweight","OUT"],["perinatal outcome, health - related behavior, or utilization of health facilities","OUT"],["number of cigarettes smoked","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women.

Taken as a whole, the results show that applied relaxation can produce significant decreases in pain, and that the addition of an operant programme does not improve pain reductions, but does tend to improve results with activity and especially medicine intake variables. The immigrants, as a group, did not benefit from the programme compared to the controls in primary care. In conclusion, this study has shown the ASES-S to be a valid measure of treatment effects also for patients with FS. At follow up, there were no obvious group differences in symptom severity, which for AE seemed to be due to a considerable compliance problem.

These data suggest that both sodium and chloride contribute to the worsening of EIA symptoms seen after consuming a normal or high NaCl diet. Our findings indicate that dietary salt loading enhances airway inflammation following exercise in asthmatic subjects, and that small salt-dependent changes in vascular volume and microvascular pressure might have substantial effects on airway function following exercise in the face of mediator-induced increased vascular permeability. These data suggest that individuals with EIA might benefit from lower salt diets.

This placebo-controlled study does not show that treatment with FPANS up to 1 year after FESS had a positive effect compared with placebo. After 11 days of treatment, significantly better results were obtained in cases of bacterial sinusitis (94% deobstruction with tixocortol pivalate-neomycin versus 74% with neomycin) than in cases of allergic sinusitis (69% deobstruction with tixocortol pivalate-neomycin versus 36% with neomycin). These findings suggest that evacuation of the pathological effusions in sinuses may exert a beneficial effect by reducing the levels of IL-1beta and IL-8, and we speculate that removal of pathological effusions from the sinuses may provide treatment through different mechanisms than those that occur in treatment with betamethasone. Topical budesonide delivered through a maxillary antrum sinusotomy tube can control chronic rhinosinusitis that persists after surgery. There is compelling evidence that topical corticosteroids down-regulate cytokine expression, and it is likely that a larger, and longer multi-centre trial may prove their efficacy in CRS. Thus, in treatment of chronic mucopurulent rhinosinusitis, reduction of the inflammatory response and decongestion make topical antibiotic unnecessary, probably by allowing host clearance mechanisms to recover. These results suggest that treatment with MFNS following sinus surgery may improve wound healing, particularly in subjects with nasal polyps. BANS is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. Topical steroid therapy did not cause any adverse effects.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8692103028,"bertscore_r":0.8330301046,"bertscore_f":0.8507356644,"rouge1_p":0.3076923077,"rouge1_r":0.1052631579,"rouge1_f":0.1568627451,"rouge2_p":0.08,"rouge2_r":0.0266666667,"rouge2_f":0.04,"rougeL_p":0.3076923077,"rougeL_r":0.1052631579,"rougeL_f":0.1568627451,"rougeLsum_p":0.3076923077,"rougeLsum_r":0.1052631579,"rougeLsum_f":0.1568627451,"ei_score":0.0367081583,"claimver":0.6910828948,"sts":0.5210973024,"nli":0.5904626846},"entities":[["subjects with nasal polyps","PAR"],["tixocortol pivalate - neomycin neomycin tixocortol pivalate - neomycin neomycin","INT"],["adverse effects","OUT"],["mfns","INT"],["steroid","INT"],["placebo fpans placebo","INT"],["bdp","INT"],["efficacy and safety","OUT"],["inflammatory response","OUT"],["topical budesonide","INT"],["bans","INT"],["wound healing","OUT"],["betamethasone","INT"],["levels il - 1beta and il - 8","OUT"],["mucopurulent","PAR"],["sinusitis","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.

These data argue strongly in favour of a therapeutic effect of branched chain amino acids in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver failure. Taking into account the crossover design, significant improvements attributable to branched chain amino acid treatment could be demonstrated in psychomotor functions (line tracing, tapping, steadiness, auditory reaction time), attention (digit table), and practical intelligence (digit symbol, number connection test).

Other measures (vibration QST, neuropathy rating scores, monofilament examination) are insensitive to changes over 12 months in a mild-to-moderate affected population of this size. The progression of mild diabetic autonomic and peripheral neuropathy may be halted or even reversed by pharmacologic intervention with the aldose-reductase inhibitor tolrestat. In conclusion, ponalrestat did not improve peripheral nerve function in diabetes mellitus patients with signs of peripheral neuropathy, although it did ameliorate a deterioration in autonomic nerve function in diabetic patients with signs of autonomic neuropathy. Tolrestat may be useful in the primary prevention of diabetic neuropathy. It is concluded that sorbinil treatment results in some improvement in peripheral nerve function in symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy, but that the long-term effect may be of limited value. Further studies are indicated with intervention at an earlier stage in the evolution of neuropathy and for longer periods. The effects of fidarestat-treatment on nerve conduction and the subjective symptoms of diabetic neuropathy provide evidence that this treatment alters the progression of diabetic neuropathy. In conclusion, one-year treatment with Tolrestat significantly improved oesophageal motility and vibration perception in Type-2 diabetic patients with asymptomatic diabetic neuropathy. The improvement after six months of therapy was mild but significant; therefore the authors conclude that the tolrestat is an useful drug in the treatment of the peripheral diabetic neuropathy in addition to attainment of a better glycemia's control. It is concluded that one-year treatment with ponalrestat has no beneficial effects on symptoms or electrophysiological parameters in diabetic neuropathy. Moreover, the deterioration of motor nerve conduction velocity and vibration threshold that had occurred in patients initially treated with placebo, was stopped during open-label treatment with tolrestat. Measurement of erythrocyte sorbitol concentrations demonstrated very significant inhibition of aldose reductase activity with sorbinil treatment, but no concomitant improvement in either peripheral or autonomic nerve function was observed. Levels of PA-I in plasma influence the amounts of t-PA precipitated in euglobulins. Overall, we found no evidence that the early clinical signs and symptoms of diabetic neuropathy were altered by sorbinil. These observations suggest that epalrestat may have therapeutic value at the early stage of diabetic neuropathy and that the pupillary light reflex and minimum latency of F-wave may be useful indicators of diabetic neuropathy. No beneficial effect of Sorbinil was demonstrated on either the clinical manifestation or on the neurophysiological measurements made in these neuropathic diabetic patients over 12 months of treatment. Diabetic patients with neuropathy have LV abnormalities that can be stabilized and partially reversed by ARI treatment. Tolrestat may therefore be helpful in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, where there is little opportunity for therapeutic intervention apart from effort to achieve normoglycaemic control. It is concluded that some sustained improvement in symptomatic diabetic neuropathy may be obtained following aldose-reductase inhibition with tolrestat 200 mg once daily. We conclude that sorbinil, as a metabolic intervention targeted against a specific biochemical consequence of hyperglycemia, can improve the neuropathologic lesions of diabetic neuropathy. Therefore these methods are recommended in future therapy trials. These results indicate that neurophysiological techniques are necessary, in conjunction with clinical measurements, for the assessment of 'early' diabetic neuropathy and that aldose reductase inhibitors are not effective in the treatment of established diabetic neuropathy. Firmer knowledge of clinico-pathological correlates allied to improved non-invasive neurophysiological measurement techniques should facilitate the selection of patients for future therapeutic trials in diabetic neuropathy. The data suggest that aldose reductase inhibition has effects on platelet reactivity and microalbuminuria.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8285619617,"bertscore_r":0.8703932762,"bertscore_f":0.848962605,"rouge1_p":0.0740740741,"rouge1_r":0.1111111111,"rouge1_f":0.0888888889,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.037037037,"rougeL_r":0.0555555556,"rougeL_f":0.0444444444,"rougeLsum_p":0.037037037,"rougeLsum_r":0.0555555556,"rougeLsum_f":0.0444444444,"ei_score":0.2389035208,"claimver":0.3465866745,"sts":0.6253323555,"nli":0.7378304005},"entities":[["tolrestat","INT"],["diabetes mellitus patients with signs of peripheral neuropathy","PAR"],["platelet reactivity microalbuminuria","OUT"],["nerve conduction subjective symptoms","OUT"],["fidarestat -","INT"],["erythrocyte sorbitol concentrations aldose reductase activity","OUT"],["zenarestat","INT"],["electrophysiological","OUT"],["oesophageal motility and vibration perception","OUT"],["diabetic patients with signs of autonomic neuropathy","PAR"],["peripheral or autonomic nerve function","OUT"],["deterioration of motor nerve conduction velocity and vibration threshold","OUT"],["neurophysiological measurements","OUT"],["ar","INT"],["( vibration qst, neuropathy rating scores, monofilament examination )","OUT"],["ponalrestat","INT"],["type - 2 diabetic patients with asymptomatic diabetic neuropathy","PAR"],["diabetic neuropathy","OUT"],["symptomatic diabetic neuropathy","OUT"],["autonomic nerve function","OUT"],["pupillary light reflex minimum latency of f - wave","OUT"],["sorbinil","INT"],["epalrestat","INT"],["placebo tolrestat","INT"],["##ologic","OUT"],["peripheral nerve function","OUT"],["neuropathic diabetic patients","PAR"],["diabetic patients with neuropathy","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of aldose reductase inhibitors in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Intensive exercise does not increase radiographic damage of the large joints, except possibly in patients with considerable baseline damage of the large joints. It is concluded that 8 wk of bicycle training does not influence the immune system of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The conclusion is that although most patients are in favour of training, the present study does not support that training lessons per se affect the disease activity or the progression of the disease.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8527857661,"bertscore_r":0.839276433,"bertscore_f":0.8459771872,"rouge1_p":0.5263157895,"rouge1_r":0.1612903226,"rouge1_f":0.2469135802,"rouge2_p":0.1666666667,"rouge2_r":0.0491803279,"rouge2_f":0.0759493671,"rougeL_p":0.3684210526,"rougeL_r":0.1129032258,"rougeL_f":0.1728395062,"rougeLsum_p":0.3684210526,"rougeLsum_r":0.1129032258,"rougeLsum_f":0.1728395062,"ei_score":0.7883744415,"claimver":0.7172089219,"sts":0.5276051164,"nli":0.5854084492},"entities":[["aerobic capacity","OUT"],["rheumatoid arthritis patients with severe limitations","PAR"],["exercise programs","INT"],["people who have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis","PAR"],["aerobic capacity, joint mobility, and muscle strength","OUT"],["patients with rheumatoid arthritis","PAR"],["intensive dynamic training","INT"],["bicycle training","INT"],["rheumatoid arthritis patients with well controlled disease","PAR"],["rom exercises isometric training","INT"],["patients","PAR"],["radiographic damage","OUT"],["intensive exercise","INT"],["elderly rheumatoid arthritis patients on steroid treatment","PAR"],["activity","OUT"],["conditioning exercise","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of exercise in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Parturients who received droperidol reported a more frequent incidence of restlessness (16%) than those who received dexamethasone (P<0.05). A subhypnotic dose of midazolam (1 mg x h(-1)) was as effective as the subhypnotic dose of propofol (1 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in parturients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. We conclude that 0.5 mg of intravenous droperidol decreases nausea in term parturients undergoing non-urgent cesarean section with epidural anesthesia without producing unwanted side-effects. Metoclopramide administered before induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery appears to significantly reduce both pre- and postdelivery emetic symptoms without apparent adverse effects on mother or neonate. Although 10 mg propofol has been described as an effective direct antiemetic, episodes of IONV were neither prevented nor reversed by its use during intradural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. The results suggest that prophylactic use of acupressure bands bilaterally on the P6 acupoint failed to prevent nausea and vomiting during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. The median difference in the cumulative fentanyl dose was 100 (75, 100) microg fentanyl, (P = 0.0002). Other variables were similar between the groups. Acupressure is an effective, non-pharmacologic method to reduce intraoperative nausea during elective cesarean section in the awake patient. The administration of supplemental oxygen from anesthetic induction until the end of the surgery did not reduce the incidence of intra- and postoperative nausea or vomiting in women undergoing cesarean section under subarachnoid block. Prophylactic IV ondansetron 8 mg is safe and effective in reducing the frequency and the severity of nausea and vomiting, but not pruritus, following cesarean delivery with intrathecal sufentanil-morphine. Further investigations are needed to see whether acupressure may be an effective non-pharmacological, non-invasive treatment for a common problem in this sub-group of patients. A bolus dose of midazolam (2 mg) was more effective than metoclopramide (10 mg) for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in parturients patients undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia, however, further studies are needed to prove the safety of midazolam in parturient patients undergoing caesarean section. Prophylactic ondansetron 4 mg IV is more effective in preventing nausea than vomiting. There were no differences in neonatal Apgar scores between groups. Dexamethasone, 5 mg i.v., is suggested as the minimum effective dose in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with epidural morphine for post-Cesarean analgesia. Both prophylactic ondansetron and droperidol were similarly effective, and significantly better than placebo, in reducing the incidence and severity of intraoperative emetic symptoms in cesarean section patients under epidural anesthesia. We conclude that the intra-operative administration of 4 mg ondansetron intravenously during Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia significantly reduces the incidence of vomiting and the severity of nausea. Nalbuphine and ondansetron are more effective than placebo for the prevention of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus after cesarean delivery. Ondansetron was effective in reducing the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving intrathecal morphine for Caesarean section. This combination was more effective than either dexamethasone 8 mg or droperidol 1.25 mg alone in preventing nausea and vomiting after spinal anesthesia using 0.5% bupivacaine and morphine 0.2 mg. We conclude that metoclopramide (15 mg) and droperidol (0.5 mg) were similarly effective. Although the ondansetron reduced the incidence of PONV and the need for further antiemetic medication, this did not affect patient's satisfaction regarding their postoperative care. The results demonstrate that prophylactic use of acupressure bands bilaterally on the P-6 acupoint can significantly reduce incidence of nausea and vomiting after epidural morphine for post-Cesarean section pain relief. It also lessens the severity of nausea and vomiting, and increases maternal satisfaction in the early postoperative period. Its use, however, was associated with a higher incidence of side effects such as dry mouth and blurry vision. droperidol reduced nausea and vomiting but did not prevent itching, and that epidural droperidol failed to prevent all side effects. There was also no difference between the two groups in nausea scores, number of vomiting episodes, or patient satisfaction with postoperative nausea and vomiting management.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8684624434,"bertscore_r":0.8539996743,"bertscore_f":0.8611702919,"rouge1_p":0.4285714286,"rouge1_r":0.1730769231,"rouge1_f":0.2465753425,"rouge2_p":0.05,"rouge2_r":0.0196078431,"rouge2_f":0.0281690141,"rougeL_p":0.2857142857,"rougeL_r":0.1153846154,"rougeL_f":0.1643835616,"rougeLsum_p":0.2857142857,"rougeLsum_r":0.1153846154,"rougeLsum_f":0.1643835616,"ei_score":0.9704139223,"claimver":0.8837195039,"sts":0.5501561761,"nli":0.6339906454},"entities":[["incidence and severity of intraoperative emetic symptoms","OUT"],["nausea and vomiting","OUT"],["patients receiving intrathecal","PAR"],["nausea scores, number of vomiting episodes, or patient satisfaction with postoperative nausea and vomiting management","OUT"],["intra - and postoperative nausea or vomiting","OUT"],["cesarean section patients under epidural anesthesia","PAR"],["sufentanil morphine","INT"],["incidence of nausea and vomiting","OUT"],["nausea than vomiting","OUT"],["severity of nausea and vomiting maternal satisfaction","OUT"],["nausea and vomiting itching","OUT"],["intraoperative nausea","OUT"],["neonatal apgar scores","OUT"],["td","INT"],["dexamethasone droperidol","INT"],["intrathecal morphine - induced pruritus","OUT"],["acupressure","INT"],["acupressure bands","INT"],["parturients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia","PAR"],["parturient patients undergoing caesarean section","PAR"],["frequent incidence of restlessness","OUT"],["side effects as dry mouth and blurry vision","OUT"],["elective cesarean section the awake patient","PAR"],["bupivacaine morphine","INT"],["midazolam propofol","INT"],["incidence of vomiting severity of nausea","OUT"],["pre - postdelivery emetic symptoms","OUT"],["ondansetron droperidol placebo","INT"],["term parturients undergoing non - urgent cesarean section with epidural anesthesia","PAR"],["droperidol","INT"],["nalbuphine and ondansetron placebo","INT"],["ondansetron","INT"],["cesarean delivery","PAR"],["propofol","INT"],["frequency severity of nausea and vomiting pruritus","OUT"],["morphine","INT"],["for caesarean section","PAR"],["parturients patients undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia","PAR"],["midazolam","INT"],["nausea","OUT"],["metoclopramide","INT"],["incidence of ponv need further antiemetic medication satisfaction","OUT"],["dexamethasone","INT"],["cumulative fentanyl dose","OUT"],["metoclopramide droperidol","INT"],["supplemental oxygen","INT"],["ionv","OUT"],["midazolam metoclopramide","INT"],["women undergoing cesarean section under subarachnoid block","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any antiemetic drug for the prevention of nausea and vomiting during caesarean section.

Body weight, IRI and GPP did not change significantly during the study. The monophasic COC NOMAC\/E2 had less influence on haemostasis, lipids and carbohydrate metabolism than the COC LNG\/EE. This effect appears to be dose-related and progressive with continued therapy; the significance of these results is discussed. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Both the vaginal ring and the oral contraceptive have no clinically relevant effects on carbohydrate metabolism, adrenal or thyroid function. In conclusion, the safety of both preparations with regard to carbohydrate metabolism was confirmed using the most accurate method available; furthermore, changes in lipid metabolism were such as to have little clinical significance. Overall there were no statistically significant differences among the three formulations in their effects on carbohydrate metabolism as measured by glucose or insulin levels after 6 months of treatment. The vaginal ring may represent an appropriate choice for long-term contraception in women at risk for developing diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. By contrast, EE\/CMA does not deteriorate SI and induces a favorable lipid profile. The NET\/EE preparation appeared to induce a greater increase in triglycerides, but no significant difference was found between the two pill preparations with respect to HDL-cholesterol changes. Carbohydrate metabolism as reflected by glucose tolerance showed deterioration with all 3 pills, being least with Microgynon 30 and greatest with Marvelon at 12 months. The glucose-induced suppression of plasma glucagon levels seemed less effective for treatment with the desogestrel-containing preparations than with the levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives. The 24-day GTD 60 microg\/EE 15 microg formulation and DSG\/EE produced similar effects on hemostatic balance, lipid metabolism and glucose tolerance, and exhibited comparable efficacy and tolerability. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The observed changes were small and not suggestive of a clinically relevant deterioration of carbohydrate metabolism. Such minor changes have not been associated with cardiovascular diseases and support the safety of low-dose triphasic preparations. every 84 +\/- 5 days for NET-EN and every 90 +\/- 5 days for DMPA, the effects on various parameters studied were less with NET-EN. The lower-dose, nonoral hormonal RING had a lesser impact on carbohydrate metabolism and greater reduction of free androgen and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels than PILL treatment. Reducing the dose of EE in oral contraceptives from 30 mcg to 20 mcg minimizes their impact on renin substrate and hemostatic parameters. Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart-New York. These alterations in carbohydrate metabolism should have no clinical significance in healthy women. The metabolic effects were similar despite the lower total steroid dose of the gestodene preparation. Further larger studies are warranted. The lipoprotein, SHBG, and protein S and factor V differences are likely due to the lesser androgenicity of DSG allowing for a greater expression of the dose of estrogen. Levonorgestrel (100 microg) with ethinyl estradiol (20 microg) provides menstrual cycle control equivalent to that obtained with triphasic norethindrone with ethinyl estradiol (75% higher estrogen dose) with similar safety and tolerability. However, these changes were of small magnitude and levels remained well within the normal range in all subjects. EE 20 microg\/DRSP 3 mg has a good safety profile comparable with EE 20 microg\/DSG 150 microg. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00185224.

Additionally, effective desloughing significantly improves healing outcomes. Residual scars were noted in 8 per cent of patients treated with honey-impregnated gauze and in 16.6 per cent of cases treated with amniotic membrane (P < 0.001). Natural honey is extremely costeffective. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. These results support the proposition that there are clinical benefits from using honey in wound care, but further research is needed. Of the wounds treated with honey, 100 per cent healed within 15 days as against 50 per cent in the wounds treated with boiled potato peel dressings (mean 10.4 vs. 16.2 days). We suggest that in another study, the efficacy of honey with standardized level of antibacterial activity is evaluated against cutaneous leishmaniasis. No statistically significant difference was found for healing times after total toenail avulsion, although the marginal benefit of the honey dressing on these healing times warrants further investigation. Honey dressing improves wound healing, makes the wound sterile in lesser time, has a better outcome in terms of prevention of hypertrophic scarring and post-burn contractures, and decreases the need of debridement irrespective of time of admission, when compared to SSD dressing. Honey dressing is a safe alternative dressing for Wagner grade-II diabetic foot ulcers. Honey appears to be more effective than sugar in reducing bacterial contamination and promoting wound healing, and slightly less painful than sugar during dressing changes and motion. The availability of suitable allogenic blood is a potential problem when TE is employed. Thus in honey dressed wounds, early subsidence of acute inflammatory changes, better control of infection and quicker wound healing was observed while in the SSD treated wounds sustained inflammatory reaction was noted even on epithelialization. Relief of pain, a lower incidence of hypertrophic scar and postburn contracture, low cost and easy availability make honey an ideal dressing in the treatment of burns. Honey impregnated gauze dressed wounds showed healing earlier as compared to OpSite (mean 10.8 versus 15.3 days).","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.873444736,"bertscore_r":0.8447651863,"bertscore_f":0.8588656187,"rouge1_p":0.3,"rouge1_r":0.1224489796,"rouge1_f":0.1739130435,"rouge2_p":0.0256410256,"rouge2_r":0.0103092784,"rouge2_f":0.0147058824,"rougeL_p":0.15,"rougeL_r":0.0612244898,"rougeL_f":0.0869565217,"rougeLsum_p":0.2,"rougeLsum_r":0.0816326531,"rougeLsum_f":0.115942029,"ei_score":0.006628367,"claimver":0.667509973,"sts":0.7853213549,"nli":0.7998218536},"entities":[["acute inflammatory changes control of infection quicker wound healing inflammatory reaction","OUT"],["honey","INT"],["honey - impregnated gauze amniotic","INT"],["healed","OUT"],["honey sugar","INT"],["honey impregnated","INT"],["bacterial contamination promoting wound healing painful","OUT"],["boiled potato peel dressings","INT"],["pain hypertrophic scar and postburn contracture","OUT"],["natural honey","INT"],["##gner grade - ii diabetic foot ulcers","PAR"],["crude undiluted honey","INT"],["healing outcomes","OUT"],["honey dressing","INT"],["eradication bacterial infections period of antibiotic use and hospital stay wound healing wound dehiscence and need for re - suturing scar formation","OUT"],["healing","OUT"],["healing times","OUT"],["wound healing sterile hypertrophic scarring and post - burn contractures need of debridement","OUT"],["residual scars","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of honey for the treatment of acute wounds.

We conclude that the decrease in red cell rigidity may have contributed to the increased walking distance. The benefit of drug plus physical therapy compared with exercise alone could be observed mainly in the first weeks of treatment and may wear off during long-term therapy. These ratios have 95% confidence limits of 0.72-1.34 and 0.74-1.25, respectively. Subjective side effects were reported by six patients in the pentoxifylline group and by three patients in the nylidrin HCl group. It is concluded that oxpentifylline , when taken in oral form at the dose used in this study, increased erythrocyte deformability without conferring any clinical or haemorrheological benefit to patients with intermittent claudication. Pentoxifylline and placebo had similar effects. For target patients, however, a multifactorial therapeutic approach, including the use of pentoxifylline, is justified. In conclusion, pentoxifylline proved more effective than the other drugs tested in: 1. improving distal pressure and resting microcirculatory blood flow; 2. increasing postexercise distal flow, ratios, and pressures and enabling faster recuperation of basal pulse rates; 3. increasing initial claudication distance in the strain test within the test group and achieving a greater absolute subjective claudication distance than that obtained using the other treatments. Results indicate good efficacy and tolerability. These results indicate that oral iloprost is not effective in improving exercise performance or quality of life in patients with PAD who have intermittent claudication. No adverse reactions were recorded during the trial. Thus the mechanisms involved in the pentoxifylline-treated group were different from those in the cilostazol-treated group, and require further study. Nausea was the only drug side effect noted. White the precise mode of therapeutic action requires clarification, pentoxifylline was well tolerated with minimal unwanted effects. In conclusion, PXF improved walking distance significantly better than placebo.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.9002643824,"bertscore_r":0.8267529607,"bertscore_f":0.861944139,"rouge1_p":0.7,"rouge1_r":0.1346153846,"rouge1_f":0.2258064516,"rouge2_p":0.3157894737,"rouge2_r":0.0582524272,"rouge2_f":0.0983606557,"rougeL_p":0.45,"rougeL_r":0.0865384615,"rougeL_f":0.1451612903,"rougeLsum_p":0.45,"rougeLsum_r":0.0865384615,"rougeLsum_f":0.1451612903,"ei_score":0.0052850725,"claimver":0.7807276249,"sts":0.7676990628,"nli":0.7358101606},"entities":[["walking distance","OUT"],["aspirin pentoxifylline","INT"],["iloprost","INT"],["placebo","INT"],["drug plus physical therapy exercise","INT"],["tolerated","OUT"],["distal pressure and resting microcirculatory blood flow ; postexercise distal flow, ratios, and pressureseration basal pulse rates initial claudication distance absolute subjective claudication distance","OUT"],["subjective side effects","OUT"],["patients with intermittent claudication","PAR"],["erythrocyte deformability","OUT"],["red cell rigidity walking distance","OUT"],["pxf","INT"],["patients with pad who have intermittent claudication","PAR"],["efficacy and tolerability","OUT"],["oxpentifylline","INT"],["adverse reactions","OUT"],["nausea","OUT"],["pentoxifylline","INT"],["level of pain","OUT"],["pentoxifylline cilostazol","INT"],["pentoxifylline placebo","INT"],["pentoxifylline nylidrin hcl","INT"],["exercise performance or quality of life","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pentoxifylline in the treatment of claudication.

We believe that this review gives conclusive evidence on the clinical efficacy of IFNs versus placebo in SPMS.","predictions":[{"exp_short":"SPNXTA","prediction":"Interferon beta has a beneficial effect on the MSFC Z-score and on the Regional Functional Status Scale in SPMS.

There was no significant difference in the failure rate of extubation among infants randomised to receive nasal CPAP or headbox oxygen in either the acute or chronic respiratory distress groups. We conclude that nasopharyngeal CPAP does not improve the likelihood of successful extubation of very low birth weight infants who are ready for extubation within the first 2 weeks of life. Data indicate that using selected clinical criteria for elective extubation of neonates weighing less than 1 kg, NCPAP facilitates successful extubation. These results suggest that application of N-CPAP to a preset protocol for extubation can achieve a better success rate of early extubation in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants. In conclusion, this study showed that a short period of nasal CPAP is not associated with a reduction in reventilation. Postextubation N-CPAP has a striking beneficial effect on respiratory function and prevention of atelectasis. Elective use of nasal continuous positive airways pressure post-extubation is not universally tolerated, but does reduce the need for additional support. The benefits of NCPAP do not seem to be associated with an increased incidence of unwanted side effects.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8697572947,"bertscore_r":0.8385487199,"bertscore_f":0.8538679481,"rouge1_p":0.44,"rouge1_r":0.125,"rouge1_f":0.1946902655,"rouge2_p":0.0416666667,"rouge2_r":0.0114942529,"rouge2_f":0.018018018,"rougeL_p":0.28,"rougeL_r":0.0795454545,"rougeL_f":0.1238938053,"rougeLsum_p":0.28,"rougeLsum_r":0.0795454545,"rougeLsum_f":0.1238938053,"ei_score":0.9926469841,"claimver":0.7428468466,"sts":0.5727585554,"nli":0.7223597765},"entities":[["n - cpap","INT"],["success rate early extubation","OUT"],["reventilation","OUT"],["unwanted side effects","OUT"],["ncpap","INT"],["respiratory function atelectasis","OUT"],["cpap","INT"],["nasopharyngeal cpap","INT"],["neonates weighing less than 1 kg","PAR"],["very low birthweight ( vlbw ) infants","PAR"],["failure rate of extubation","OUT"],["vlbw infants","PAR"],["nasal cpap headbox oxygen","INT"],["successful extubation","OUT"],["very low birth weight infants who are ready for extubation within the first 2 weeks of life","PAR"],["nasal continuous positive airways pressure","INT"],["extubation outcome","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure for early extubation in preterm infants.

It is necessary, however, to further confirm the efficacy of colchicine by examining histological changes and following the patients for longer periods. These data suggest that UDCA frequently is superior to colchicine and especially to placebo in the treatment of PBC. The addition of colchicine to ursodeoxycholic acid in patients with symptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis results in a small but significant reduction of disease progress. Both colchicine and methotrexate improved biochemical test results and symptoms in primary biliary cirrhosis, but the response to methotrexate was greater. We conclude that colchicine is of clinical benefit to patients with primary biliary cirrhosis as judged by improvement in alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities as well as a tendency for stabilization of bilirubin values. In conclusion, this study suggests that colchicine appears to provide a slight advantage relative to UDCA alone in patients with nonadvanced PBC.

Treatment is best started before growth retardation becomes considerable. This suggests that this higher GH dose may be beneficial for children with severe growth retardation secondary to CRI. The use of rhGH in growth-retarded children with chronic renal failure may facilitate the achievement of the inherent growth potential of such children. In conclusion, rhGH is effective in improving the growth velocity of pediatric renal allograft recipients and is not associated with an increase in adverse events. The low start dose (2 IU\/m2\/ day) was of no advantage compared to the high dose. Phosphate, ALP, PTH, and insulin increased during the first year of treatment. These observations suggest that, in children with growth failure associated with chronic renal failure: (i) IGFBP-2, and not IGFBP-3, is likely to be a growth inhibitor; (ii) rhGH stimulates catch-up growth in part by increasing serum levels of IGF peptides; and (iii) linear growth is influenced by the balance between growth stimulating IGFs and growth inhibitory IGFBPs. Our results show that sustained improvement of height can be achieved with GH in severely growth-retarded adolescents after renal transplantation. Thus, growth hormone therapy improves linear growth and maintains bone mass, but does not favorably affect bone formation rates in stable pediatric renal allograft recipients.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8388335705,"bertscore_r":0.8614388108,"bertscore_f":0.8499859571,"rouge1_p":0.1578947368,"rouge1_r":0.0909090909,"rouge1_f":0.1153846154,"rouge2_p":0.0555555556,"rouge2_r":0.03125,"rouge2_f":0.04,"rougeL_p":0.1578947368,"rougeL_r":0.0909090909,"rougeL_f":0.1153846154,"rougeLsum_p":0.1578947368,"rougeLsum_r":0.0909090909,"rougeLsum_f":0.1153846154,"ei_score":0.7132021754,"claimver":0.4680613279,"sts":0.4102739692,"nli":0.4203717113},"entities":[["gh","INT"],["growth - retarded children with chronic renal failure","PAR"],["rhgh","INT"],["linear growth bone mass bone formation rates","OUT"],["pediatric renal allograft recipients","PAR"],["severely growth - retarded adolescents after renal transplantation","PAR"],["linear","OUT"],["growth velocity","OUT"],["children with growth failure associated with chronic renal failure","PAR"],["stable pediatric renal allograft recipients","PAR"],["infants with crf and growth retardation despite good control","PAR"],["children with severe growth retardation secondary to cri","PAR"],["height","OUT"],["growth hormone therapy","INT"],["adverse events","OUT"],["phosphate, alp, pth, and insulin","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is no evidence that growth hormone treatment improves growth in children with chronic renal failure.

Venlafaxine therefore proved to be significantly more effective than fluoxetine in improving depressive symptoms and concomitant anxiety. Fluoxetine was associated more frequently with weight loss (p = .002) and less frequently with dizziness (p = .04) than trazodone. These results are discussed in the context of selecting between nortriptyline and fluoxetine for a particular depressed patient. A significantly smaller percentage of fluoxetine than imipramine patients terminated therapy because of adverse experiences. This study does not support previous claims of specific adverse effects of fluoxetine on anxiety and suicidality. In this study, fluoxetine relieved the symptoms of major depressive illness effectively and significantly better than placebo and was better tolerated than imipramine. Significantly fewer fluoxetine-treated patients discontinued due to adverse events than did imipramine-treated patients (7% vs. 30%, respectively). It was concluded that fluoxetine provides effective antidepressant activity with fewer and less troublesome side effects than imipramine. Fluoxetine treatment resulted in weight loss, whereas imipramine treatment resulted in a slight but significant weight increase. In this study, both tianeptine and fluoxetine exhibited a good efficacy and safety. Normal cyclical ovulation, and estrogen release may have a clinically relevant pharmacodynamic interaction with serotonergic antidepressants. Compared to imipramine, fluoxetine was associated with fewer complaints of dry mouth, constipation, and dizziness. At the time of the study, FF1 = $US0.1993. Evidence that moclobemide may be more effective requires confirmation in a larger comparative study incorporating a placebo control group. It is likely that fluoxetine will be marketed with a proposed dose range lower than the one used here. Fluoxetine was as effective as imipramine in this population of inpatients. In line with analogous Western reports, the safety of mirtazapine and fluoxetine was comparable for our depressed Chinese patients; however, slightly different side effect profiles were noted for the 2 drugs in our study. The results suggest that early signs of response to fluoxetine are not dependent on achieving steady-state levels of the drug. Fluoxetine was found to have a more marked therapeutic effect than that of amineptine: better efficacy, fewer side-effects, and quicker and better improvement on the self evaluation scales. It was concluded that fluoxetine is as effective as phenelzine in the treatment of atypical depression, but produces fewer adverse effects and is better tolerated. In summary, fluvoxamine and fluoxetine were equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms, but the two drugs displayed slightly different side-effect profiles. Regardless of how strict the definition of response, we found fluoxetine to be as effective as doxepin in our group of melancholic outpatients. The 2 antidepressants proved to be suitable for the long-term treatment of depression in the elderly and to be devoid of detrimental effects on the tested cognitive functions. These data indicate that duloxetine is efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated and safe. Based on remission criteria (HAM-D < 7 or CGI of 1), venlafaxine was superior to fluoxetine. Further studies, including parallel placebo-controlled comparisons with nefazodone, are needed to further test this hypothesis. We found that mirtazapine was as well tolerated as fluoxetine and significantly more effective after 3 and 4 weeks of therapy. Important differences were found in the side-effects profile of each group, their incidence being significantly lower and tending to disappear during the course of treatment in the group of patients treated with fluoxetine. Amitriptyline did not significantly alter the STIs. Once-daily venlafaxine XR is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of major depression and concomitant anxiety and provides evidence for superiority over fluoxetine. Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. During the study, the safety of the two treatments was comparable. Side-effect profiles were not significantly different between groups except for a significantly greater frequency of dose-related increase in heart rate > or = 100 bpm in milnacipran recipients and a significantly greater weight loss in fluoxetine recipients. However, both a survival analysis and a new measure that takes account of prolonged periods of noncompliance distinguished between the treatments and was associated with improvement in both groups. In fact clinical efficacy seems to remain comparable while side-effects are significantly less frequent. Both sertraline and fluoxetine were well tolerated with no significant differences between treatments. The Hypericum preparation tested in this study is therapeutically equivalent to fluoxetine and is therefore a rational alternative to synthetic antidepressants. The results are important when striving to maximize compliance with pharmacotherapy in order to minimize recidivism and associated psychological and economic morbidity. In summary, our results, although limited by the lack of a significant difference from placebo in treatment outcome, suggest that the SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine have comparable antidepressant and antianxiety efficacies among depressed outpatients, as well as similar safety and tolerability profiles. Side effects were present in most patients on the two active drugs; those on fluoxetine experienced nausea and vomiting, and those on mianserin drowsiness. Patients taking fluoxetine reported less side-effects than those taking amitriptyline. The results of this study suggest that venlafaxine XR is as well-tolerated as fluoxetine but may have some efficacy advantages over fluoxetine. The opportunity was taken to compare the relationship of some standard measures of depressive illness, two observer based--Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979)--and a self-rating scale--Levine Pilowsky Depression questionnaire (Pilowsky et al., 1969). The results indicate that reboxetine is an effective and well tolerated antidepressant, being more effective than fluoxetine in patients with severe depression, and more effective in terms of social functioning in those patients who achieved remission. Sexual dysfunction was reported in two patients taking fluoxetine. Subjects taking sertraline, 100 mg, and fluoxetine, 20 mg, demonstrated an earlier treatment response compared with subjects taking sertraline, 50 mg. For patients without a positive response at 6 weeks, an increased antidepressant dose resulted in remission for a substantial proportion of patients when assessed 4 weeks later. A daily dosage of 300 mg of moclobemide and 20 mg of fluoxetine would thus appear to be comparable both in antidepressant efficacy and tolerability. These led to abandonment of treatment and therefore premature withdrawal from the study in 8 cases. Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. These results support the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine in comparison with fluoxetine for treating outpatients with major depression. Weight gain was detected only in patients receiving amitriptyline. Separate analysis of patients who had received an adequate trial of medication indicated a trend toward relatively more fluoxetine-treated patients meeting clinical criteria for resolved depression. Improvement was not only seen in dimensions measuring depression or mental health but also in other dimensions. Numbers of patients reporting side-effects were similar but the profiles of side-effects were different, with more patients on amitriptyline reporting anticholinergic and intolerable side-effects. Both bupropion and fluoxetine demonstrated similar efficacy in relieving depression and accompanying symptoms of anxiety, and both exhibited a similar, favorable safety profile. These differential sleep EEG effects are consistent with the notion that nefazodone and fluoxetine may have somewhat different modes and spectra of action. The results of this study indicate that venlafaxine is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of major depression at doses of 37.5 or 75 mg twice daily and not significantly different from fluoxetine 20 or 40 mg once daily. Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Tolerance of both drugs was judged to be high. Furthermore, in cases where, for various reasons, the treatment of choice is noradrenergic, it may be worthwhile to consider a supplementary serotonergic drug to improve memory deficits. The authors hypothesize that fluoxetine 20 mg\/day may be an ineffective dosage of the drug or that fluoxetine has a slower onset of antidepressant action than does trazodone. There were no haematological or clinical chemistry changes. Improvement in overall depression and in associated insomnia was achieved by most patients regardless of baseline insomnia. Venlafaxine 75 mg daily is comparable to fluoxetine, but at 150 mg daily, it may be superior to fluoxetine in outpatients with major depression who do not respond early to treatment. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The results support previous studies which suggest fluoxetine's superior side-effect profile and the approximate antidepressant equivalence of fluoxetine and TCAs. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea and vomiting in both groups. Pramipexole helped safely alleviate the symptoms of depression at 1.0 mg per day and especially in those patients who could tolerate the escalation to 5 mg per day. These data suggest that both agents have a similar efficacy and tolerability but that moclobemide has an earlier onset of antidepressive action. By contrast, 13.5% of sertraline-treated patients discontinued prematurely because of clinical improvement, compared with 10.7% of fluoxetine-treated patients. Each treatment was similarly effective in improving depression in this subtype of patients with anxious depression. As expected, in the amisulpride group endocrine-like adverse events in female patients were the most common, while nausea, dyspepsia, anorexia and insomnia occurred more frequently with fluoxetine. The amitriptyline-treated group had complaints of dry mouth and dizziness on standing; the fluoxetine-treated group of sleep disturbances, nausea, and headaches.

Conclusions: Elimination of the presumed structural risk from the dental occlusion appeared to significantly reduce the incidence of temporomandibular disorders in a select group of young subjects.

In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass, the administration of simvastatin doses not produce any changes in the inflammatory response as measured by the levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and SIRS score, nor does it reduce the complications after cardiac surgery. We believe that routine preoperative use of fluvastatin should be carefully considered. Pretreatment with atorvastatin significantly increases the amount of EPCs after CPB, by a mechanism independent of plasma levels of cytokines and cholesterol. Administration of atorvastatin 20 mg\/day, initiated 1 week before elective off-pump CABG and continued in the postoperative period, significantly decreases postoperative AF. Pretreatment with atorvastatin significantly reduces cytokine release and neutrophil adhesion to the venous endothelium in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. Pretreatment with atorvastatin significantly reduced the occurrence of postoperative AF after off-pump CABG. These data show that acute preoperative statin therapy fails to limit the inflammatory response to CPB; however, the data also document a major upregulation of NF-kappaB during cardiac operations, thereby providing a sound rationale for interventions targeted at inactivating this key component of the inflammatory cascade. Pravastatin;s effects on the expression of these pivotal inflammatory mediators strongly support its well-timed use in CPB. These results may influence practice patterns with regard to adjuvant pharmacological therapy before cardiac surgery.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8769650459,"bertscore_r":0.8747740984,"bertscore_f":0.8758682013,"rouge1_p":0.5,"rouge1_r":0.25,"rouge1_f":0.3333333333,"rouge2_p":0.1578947368,"rouge2_r":0.0769230769,"rouge2_f":0.1034482759,"rougeL_p":0.45,"rougeL_r":0.225,"rougeL_f":0.3,"rougeLsum_p":0.45,"rougeLsum_r":0.225,"rougeLsum_f":0.3,"ei_score":0.0010961893,"claimver":0.7748206854,"sts":0.685839951,"nli":0.7010197639},"entities":[["inflammatory response levels il - 6, il - 8, tnf - alpha and sirs score complications","OUT"],["postoperative af","OUT"],["statin pretreatment","INT"],["patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass","PAR"],["fluvastatin","INT"],["amount of epcs","OUT"],["statin","INT"],["inflammatory response","OUT"],["pravastatin ;","INT"],["cytokine release neutrophil adhesion","OUT"],["simvastatin","INT"],["atorvastatin","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of statins in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

We found it to be effective for postoperative hemostasis and for preventing ischemic reperfusion injury. Further studies, using higher doses, will be required to define the value of urodilatin for prevention of renal impairment after liver transplantation. It is concluded that parenteral ANP increases CCr and reduces need for dialysis in patients with established intrinsic ARF. These results imply that renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the incidence of postoperative HT and RD, and suggest that hANP infusion is a simple, reliable, and effective method for management during the immediate period after AAA operations. It is therefore considered that hANP might not only be effective for overcoming some major shortcomings of cardiopulmonary bypass, but also might be effective to attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury, protect the myocardium, have an anti-arrhythmic effect, and suppress left ventricular remodeling. The results suggest that the technique is useful for the management of hemodynamics and water-sodium retention after cardiopulmonary bypass. hANP can satisfactorily compensate for the shortcomings of CPB by decreasing the peripheral vascular resistance, suppressing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and exerting a strong diuretic effect. We conclude that URO seems to be a new approach for the treatment of therapy-resistant postoperative ARF following LTx. Infusion of h-ANP at a rate of 50 ng.kg(-1).min(-1) enhances renal excretory function, decreases the probability of dialysis, and improves dialysis-free survival in early, ischemic acute renal dysfunction after complicated cardiac surgery. We conclude that Urodilatin does not reduce the incidence of acute renal failure and the subsequent requirement for hemofiltration \/ hemodialysis in our patient population, but seems to reduce the duration of hemofiltration and frequency of hemodialysis compared to the placebo group. Further prospective clinical trials are needed to answer the question whether a different patient collective or a prophylactic administration of Ularitide are more promising approaches in the clinical setting of oliguric acute renal failure. In conclusion, administration of intravenous anaritide before and during a radiocontrast study did not reduce the incidence of RCIN in patients with preexisting chronic renal failure, with or without diabetes mellitus. Continuous infusion of synthetic human atrial natriuretic peptide might be effective for preventing acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis after liver transplantation. This well-characterized population with oliguric acute renal failure had an overall high morbidity and mortality. However, anaritide may improve dialysis-free survival in patients with oliguria and may worsen it in patients without oliguria who have acute tubular necrosis. On the basis of these results it would appear that urodilatin is an effective drug for the treatment of incipient oliguric acute renal failure following cardiac surgery and for avoiding haemodialysis\/haemofiltration. This clinical study under double blind conditions revealed that the addition of urodilatin to the standard diuretic therapy of low-dose dopamine and furosemide failed to improve renal function in patients with established acute renal failure and that urodilatin did not eliminate the need for apparatus-based renal replacement treatment.

The data indicate that caffeine at a dose of 5 mg\/kg can produce significant percentage improvement in FEV1, FEF25-75, and Vmax25 in adult asthmatics. We conclude that caffeinated foods and beverages are unlikely to acutely influence FENO in subjects with asthma, and protocols for laboratory measurement do not need to take this factor into account.

The pharmacokinetics suggest that modification of the treatment schedule may result in a reduction of treatment-related toxicity. These observations suggest that a tandem high-dose ICE regimen with autologous PBSCT is feasible with some clinical efficacy in the control of refractory STS. We conclude that high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation may be of use as treatment for inoperable residual disease after resection of the primary lesion in gastrointestinal and other soft tissue sarcomas. High-dose chemotherapy did not seem to change the results in desmoplastic small round-cell tumour. The results suggest that selected alkylating agents can be combined in full or nearly full doses before nonmyelosuppressive dose-limiting toxicity precludes further escalation. Copyright (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. These data justify continued investigation of ASCT as a consolidation therapy in patients with metastatic or relapsed ES and DSRCT. As the hemopoietic recovery was equal to that seen after PBSCT, we suggest that the use of 'mobilized bone marrow' is a good alternative for PBSCT in children if contraindications to the collection of PBSCT are present. He died four years later due to a ventricular arrhythmia. To gain additional insight on DSRCT with ovarian involvement, the literature was reviewed and summarized. With spindle cell sarcomas, the efficacy of this treatment was temporary, so it will be necessary to investigate frequent high-dose chemotherapy and to change the high-dose chemotherapy regimen. For control of DSRCT, our experience supports intensive use of HD-CAV, aggressive surgery to resect visible disease, radiotherapy to high-risk sites, and myeloablative chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue in selected cases. Copyright 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel This case report suggests a role for autologous stem cell transplantation as part of multimodality therapy for this unusual and aggressive malignancy. The next step in these particularly poor prognosis metastatic MMT will be to investigate HDT combined with other drugs, known to be efficient at high doses. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of tandem HDCT in patients with high-risk or metastatic\/recurrent sarcoma, with some patients achieving long-term PFS and OS. In order for this approach to have a more significant impact on overall survival, it may need to be applied earlier in the natural history of the malignancy. Subsequent trials should attempt to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell rescue. Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society. The uniform survival achieved in our series indicates potential benefit for the combination of dose-intensive multiagent chemotherapy, local irradiation, and aggressive surgical approach in this disease.

Ivanova was awarded the institution's diplomas as a part of Biotech prize for the development of new methods of treatment of malignant tumors in children. : (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel Use of a carboplatin dose based on GFR should optimise effectiveness in patients with good renal function and avoid excessive toxicity where renal function is impaired. Nevertheless, high-dose chemotherapy as a possible consolidation strategy remains highly investigational. With the common use of neuroleptic and other related psychotropic medications in the peri-transplant period and the associated physiologic stress of the procedure, we believe that NMS may be unrecognized and account for significant morbidity in this setting. Favorable results for disease control, manageable toxicity, and the antitumor profiles of topotecan, thiotepa, and carboplatin, support use of this three-drug regimen in the treatment of neuroblastoma and brain tumors; applicability to other tumors is still uncertain. These results suggest that there are active HDC schedules on metastatic sarcomas, but its possible benefit would be limited to the consolidation of a CR obtained with previous CT. HDC is a therapeutical alternative under investigation in patients with metastatic sarcomas with an indication that could be extended to cover localized sarcomas with poor prognosis. In each case, when considering this diagnosis on the morphologic grounds an attempt to analyze the translocation using PCR should be made, including the recognition of its uncommon variants. Despite all therapeutic modalities the outcome is dismal and surgical efforts can be considered only as palliative. Tumor regression has been noted during multiagent chemotherapy, but prolonged survival is rare with current therapies. Single or double HDT with autologous PBSCT after each cycle is feasible in children and offers basic data for conducting phase III paediatric clinical studies. One alternative involves immunologic attack against markers derived from tumor-specific chromosomal defects such as those found in our patient. These data indicate that (1) patients achieving a CR or PR following induction, with preserved performance status and R (0) resection may benefit from ASCT and (2) that this can be an useful therapeutic modality in a subset of patients, in some achieving remarkable responses. We review the clinical picture of the tumor in this patient and discuss its diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment. Immunotherapy using DCs and tumor-specific peptides may be a safe approach in the treatment of childhood cancer. 2006 American Cancer Society Copyright 2003 S.

This provided a foundation for improvement and the process thus instigated resulted in the doctors providing better quality patient care. The third group of residents served as a concurrent control, and data on the testing patterns of residents at the same hospital during the year before the study provided a retrospective control. Behavior changes persisted at 6 and 12 months after intervention. Change after mutual practice visits and feedback by peers is more marked than after a visit and feedback by a non-physician observer. Physician interventions that included practice-level feedback about monitoring of glycemic control successfully led to improved care of diabetic Medicare beneficiaries. These results demonstrate that Network feedback, coupled with the intensive intervention, resulted in improvement in care that would otherwise not have occurred. At a time of heightened national attention toward measures of antimicrobial prophylaxis performance, the trial did not demonstrate a benefit of participation in a quality improvement collaborative over performance feedback for improvement of these measures. Future researchers should consider providing point-of-care decision support with redesign of office systems and\/or incentives to increase appropriate actions in response to decision-support information. A multicomponent implementation strategy consisting of feedback, benchmarking, academic detailing, facilitation, and IT support increased implementation of evidence-based processes for delivering preventive services to a greater extent than performance feedback and benchmarking alone. Both strategies are feasible within most laboratory settings. Use of a registry-generated audit, feedback, and patient reminder intervention in a resident continuity clinic modestly improved diabetes care processes, but did not influence intermediate clinical outcomes. A need exists for further studies to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of more intensive report card interventions. Unimproved tasks were associated with the perceived need for delivery system changes beyond the immediate control of the individual practitioner. The dissemination of guidelines in the format of prioritized review criteria does not increase adherence to recommendations in comparison with the traditional guideline format, and the further provision of feedback has minimal additional effect. http:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00187460. Intensive data-based feedback using report cards may not be a successful way to improve ambulatory performance of medical house officers. Among the methods examined, faculty chart review seems to be the most effective method of reducing the amount of laboratory testing performed by house staff. Additional organizational change and\/or patient activation strategies may improve plan-wide testing, particularly among asymptomatic women. Audit-feedback systems to improve quality of care are feasible and effective also in hospital settings in low-income countries. This process, composed of collaborative efforts between academic institutions and a managed care organization, may be beneficial to other health care systems. Further research is necessary to evaluate strategies for improving the self-management of asthma patients. The interventions significantly improved the quality of management of oral anticoagulation by Belgian GPs, mainly as a result of an education and support programme. However, it is more difficult to increase use of effective but riskier treatments (eg, thrombolysis) for frail elderly patients. Copyright 1999 American Health Foundation and Academic Press. It appears that only those nursing homes that sought the additional intensive support of the GCNS were able to effect enough change in clinical practice to improve resident outcomes significantly. This was possibly attributable to high pre-intervention compliance and the limited impact of the strategy on factors outside the perceived control of clinical staff. Greater understanding of the underlying processes in improving performance within multidisciplinary teams through further, theory-driven studies with no intervention\" control groups and longer follow-up are needed. Participants identified SPC charts as an effective communication tool and valuable for disseminating WA-MRSA data. Multifaceted interventions appear effective in improving prescribing. Combined physician and patient interventions lowers blood pressure; future research should focus on enhancing effectiveness and sustainability of these interventions. Partnering generalists with diabetes specialists may be important to enhance diabetes management in other primary care settings.

Our results suggest that the initiation of NAC treatment >24 hrs after hospital admission may potentially be harmful, and further studies should be undertaken to investigate the clinical use of the early application of NAC in critically ill patients. We conclude that N-acetylcysteine infusion does not result in clinically relevant improvements in global VO2, or in clinical markers of tissue hypoxia in patients with severe fulminant hepatic failure. Evaluation of three isoforms of glutathione-S-transferase (GST M1, P1 and T1), in these patients have showed an association between GST M1 null, and GST M1 and T1 double null polymorphisms with increased mortality in control group, suggesting antioxidant therapy critical for this group of patients. In this phase II, randomized, controlled trial, high-dose N-acetylcysteine was no more effective than placebo in attenuating cardiopulmonary bypass-related acute renal failure in high-risk cardiac surgery patients. However, our results do not support the use of NAC in patients with severe sepsis. N-Acetylcysteine decreased pump-induced oxidoinflammatory response during CPB, suggesting that it could be a novel therapy for assisting in the prevention of CBP-induced oxidoinflammatory damage. Whether the N-acetylcysteine challenge was merely diagnostic or whether N-acetylcysteine can be effective in the treatment of sepsis deserves further investigation. The attenuated production of IL-8, a potential mediator of septic lung injury, may have contributed to the lung-protective effects of NAC. This suggests that pretreatment with NAC could be considered to attenuate impaired tissue oxygenation and to preserve myocardial performance better in cardiac risk patients during hyperoxia. There were no significant effects on mortality, morbidity or postoperative graft function. This study failed to show any beneficial effect of the intraoperative administration of NAC on hemodynamics and graft function in liver transplantation in patients with chronic liver disease. Since the release of mediators, especially MPO, is not affected, this diminished activity of elastase may be achieved by enhanced inactivation by antiproteases after initial treatment. Based on these findings NAC appears to act as an oxygen free radical scavenger during open-heart surgery. All rights reserved. Development of ARDS and mortality were not reduced significantly by this therapy. Because of its correlation with liver blood flow index, MEGX may be helpful in identifying patients who benefit from NAC treatment in early septic shock. In conclusion, N-acetylcysteine did not offer any significant protection from renal injury during elective aortic operation in patients with normal preoperative renal function, and some degree of tubular injury seems to occur before aortic crossclamp. In this relatively small group of patients presenting with an established ARDS subsequent to a variety of underlying diseases, intravenous NAC treatment during 72 hours neither improved systemic oxygenation nor reduced the need for ventilatory support. The result of this study indicates that NAC treatment decreases the incidence of postoperative AF. There was no effect in other pulmonary parameters and in terms of intubation time. Our results do not support the routine use of N-acetylcysteine as a prophylactic measure during surgery, and reinforce previous evidence which challenges the indication of N-acetylcysteine in the critically ill. N-acetylcysteine had no renoprotective effect in patients with pre-existing renal failure undergoing cardiac surgery. Such treatment may shorten the duration of acute lung injury, but larger studies are needed to confirm this. Further strategies to decrease reperfusion injury should be devised. Adjunctive therapy with N-acetyl-L-cysteine in newly diagnosed septic shock was associated with a depression in cardiovascular performance, as indicated by progressive reductions in cardiac index, left ventricular stroke work index, and MAP. Treatment with NAC had no effect on outcome in patients with severe falciparum malaria in this setting. This study suggests that the putative beneficial effects of NAC on radiocontrast nephropathy might not be applicable to other situations, such as ARF associated with elective aortic aneurysm repair. Before further clinical studies are started, problems with N-acetylcysteine and coagulation have to be elucidated in order to find out whether N-acetylcysteine could have a beneficial effect in the treatment of ARDS. Reactive oxygen species scavenging with N-acetylcysteine attenuates myocardial oxidative stress in the hearts of patients subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. Results of this study indicated that periprocedural use of NAC as intravenously did not attenuate myocardial damage after on-pump CABG surgery. The trial confirms that NAC and rutin are efficient in protecting the lungs of patients with ARDS. We believe that its effects on clinical outcome may be more apparent in patients prone to ischemia-reperfusion injury. The dose and duration of NAC used, though higher than most renal protection studies, may have been ineffective for raising GSH levels in some patients. Further research is required to identify CABG patients at risk for postoperative renal events, valid markers of renal dysfunction, and to establish renal thresholds associated with important clinical outcomes. Intravenous administration of N-acetylcysteine does not clearly prevent postoperative acute renal failure in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing cardiac surgery. Given this finding, N-acetylcysteine should be definitively evaluated in a large randomized trial. Acetylcysteine is safe and effective in fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose. Further studies are warranted.

Laboratory tests, urine analysis, cardiovascular and ophthalmological investigations showed no significant abnormalities. The maintenance of therapeutic response after conversion to oral concentrate was comparable with the two drugs. Adverse reactions were also less troublesome with loxapine. Thus a previous finding, based on retrospective analyses, that loxapine was superior to other neuroleptics in the treatment of paranoid schizophrenia was not verified in this prospective study. Loxapine succinate was judged to be an effective treatment for newly admitted schizophrenic patients. On the basis of this study, and in comparison with trifluoperazine, it appears that loxapine is an efficacious and essentially safe medication, suitable for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. One might speculate that the relatively short duration of treatment in this study might account for the difference between these disappointing results and the more gratifying results of a previous loxapine study in chronic long-term institutionalized schizophrenics with the same oral dose. The principal side effects were drowsiness and extrapyramidal signs. Side effects were minimal during the intramuscular phase; dystonia was most common during the oral phase. In conclusion, it was found that loxapine and perphenazine seemed to be equally effective and, based on experience with parenteral loxapine treatment, it is suggested that further investigation of oral loxapine should be carried out in psychotic patients in whom agitation is a feature.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.923660934,"bertscore_r":0.8600565195,"bertscore_f":0.8907247782,"rouge1_p":0.6428571429,"rouge1_r":0.1034482759,"rouge1_f":0.1782178218,"rouge2_p":0.3076923077,"rouge2_r":0.0465116279,"rouge2_f":0.0808080808,"rougeL_p":0.6428571429,"rougeL_r":0.1034482759,"rougeL_f":0.1782178218,"rougeLsum_p":0.6428571429,"rougeLsum_r":0.1034482759,"rougeLsum_f":0.1782178218,"ei_score":0.6360761656,"claimver":0.7575746179,"sts":0.5346140862,"nli":0.6572909355},"entities":[["trifluoperazine loxapine","INT"],["side effects dystonia","OUT"],["loxapine perphenazine lox loxapine","INT"],["loxapine","INT"],["drowsiness and extrapyramidal signs","OUT"],["vital signs laboratory data untoward effects","OUT"],["psychotic patients in whom agitation","PAR"],["maintenance of therapeutic response","OUT"],["newly admitted schizophrenic patients","PAR"],["chronic long - term institutionalized schizophrenics","PAR"],["adverse reactions","OUT"],["laboratory tests, urine analysis, cardiovascular and ophthalmological investigations","OUT"],["loxapine succinate","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of loxapine in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Therefore a consensus must be found as to 'best practice' physiotherapy for Parkinson's disease.\nThe efficacy of 'standard' physiotherapy should be proved first before examining variations in physiotherapy methods. Therefore large well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to judge the effect of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. After this large RCTs are needed to demonstrate the most effective form of physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients, carers, physiotherapists and physicians should be chosen and the patients monitored for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any effect.

The decrease in speed of these performance-determining variables in the bilateral task warrants consideration during physical therapy intervention for patients with hemiparesis. Nonetheless, on the basis of findings from other studies in which functional improvements occurred in both acute and chronic severely stroke-affected subjects, outcome forecasting for the hemiplegic upper extremity should only eventuate after provision of practice under optimal learning conditions. This impairment in coordination was not due to lateral deviation of the impaired limb. Training with bilateral arm movements may be considered as a treatment strategy, and can be incorporated in stroke rehabilitation to facilitate greater arm active movement and improve motor control performance in the affected arm. These results are discussed in light of the need for further device development and continued clinical trials. These preliminary findings suggest that BATRAC induces reorganization in contralesional motor networks and provide biological plausibility for repetitive bilateral training as a potential therapy for upper extremity rehabilitation in hemiparetic stroke. These findings support the use of BAT to improve motor control and motor function of the affected upper limb in stroke patients. These findings demonstrate that even clinically minor residual motor deficits can be improved by a structured training for the affected arm. Chronic hemiparesis decreased considerably in the wrist and fingers as CVA patients expanded their motor repertoire. In contrast, distributed CIT may produce greater functional gains for the affected UL in subjects with mild to moderate chronic hemiparesis. Overall, these findings indicated improved motor capabilities of the impaired muscles as evidenced by the higher voluntary EMG activation levels. Overall, these findings suggest that a short-term bilateral training intervention may be effective in facilitating upper limb motor function in chronic stroke patients. Intervention timing, task characteristics, dose, and intensity of training may have influenced the results and are therefore areas for future investigation. Bilateral training may be more advantageous for proximal arm function. (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel. Moreover, these intralimb transfer findings extend the evidence favoring motor improvements for coupled bilateral protocols during chronic stroke. Interlimb coupling effects during bilateral reaching are retained even after chronic stroke and can be used to produce an immediate improvement in paretic arm reaching performance.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8896097541,"bertscore_r":0.836853683,"bertscore_f":0.8624256849,"rouge1_p":0.64,"rouge1_r":0.115942029,"rouge1_f":0.1963190184,"rouge2_p":0.1666666667,"rouge2_r":0.0291970803,"rouge2_f":0.049689441,"rougeL_p":0.44,"rougeL_r":0.0797101449,"rougeL_f":0.1349693252,"rougeLsum_p":0.44,"rougeLsum_r":0.0797101449,"rougeLsum_f":0.1349693252,"ei_score":0.1598285212,"claimver":0.7728263736,"sts":0.5915988684,"nli":0.6695387363},"entities":[["patients with hemiparesis","PAR"],["impairment and disabilities functional outcomes","OUT"],["training bilateral arm movements","INT"],["##etic","PAR"],["motor capabilities voluntary emg activation levels","OUT"],["bilateral training","INT"],["subjects with mild to moderate chronic hemiparesis","PAR"],["chronic stroke patients","PAR"],["motor control and motor function","OUT"],["coordination","OUT"],["cit","INT"],["therapy","INT"],["reaching","OUT"],["bat","INT"],["chronic hemiparesis","OUT"],["arm training programme","INT"],["speed","OUT"],["batrac","INT"],["gains","OUT"],["upper limb motor function","OUT"],["severely stroke - affected subjects","PAR"],["stroke patients","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of either unilateral or combined arm training for people with hemiparesis following stroke.

In the event of a need for a trial, a large prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, which compares diazepam alone with combinations of other drugs (excluding diazepam) will be ideal.","predictions":[{"exp_short":"SPNXTA","prediction":"Diazepam did not appear to have a beneficial effect on the allergic reactions associated with tetanus.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8774381876,"bertscore_r":0.8688378334,"bertscore_f":0.8731168509,"rouge1_p":0.4074074074,"rouge1_r":0.3333333333,"rouge1_f":0.3666666667,"rouge2_p":0.0769230769,"rouge2_r":0.0625,"rouge2_f":0.0689655172,"rougeL_p":0.2962962963,"rougeL_r":0.2424242424,"rougeL_f":0.2666666667,"rougeLsum_p":0.2962962963,"rougeLsum_r":0.2424242424,"rougeLsum_f":0.2666666667,"ei_score":0.0012347113,"claimver":0.6227263808,"sts":0.6044104695,"nli":0.6687937379},"entities":[["diazepam","INT"],["allergic reactions","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"6GBRY0","prediction":"","annotations":[],"scores":{},"entities":[]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of tetanus vaccination on childhood mortality.

This study seems to demonstrate that the surgical application of fibrin glue on the fissural and\/or intersegmentary dissection planes is feasible but, as compared to electrocoagulation, does not significantly improve the quality of the surgical results for partial pulmonary excision; however its use could reduce the duration of post-operative drainage. Although this pilot study showed advantages in terms of hospitalization and cost benefits, further multicentric studies are required to clarify that these differences are statistically significant. No adverse drug event related to fibrin glueing was observed. In the subgroup of patients with established air leakage, TC showed superior potential in reduction of intra-operative air leakage as well as in reduction of intensity and duration of postoperative air leakage. Fibrin glue does not add to conventional techniques in reducing moderate to severe alveolar air leak after thoracic operations. Surgical lung sealant may be a useful adjunct to conventional techniques for reducing moderate and severe AAL after lobectomy, but its use seems to increase the risk of postoperative empyema. Vivostat fibrin sealant significantly reduces post-surgical air leakage and drainage volumes following lobectomy in pulmonary surgery and is suitable for routine use in this procedure. The surgical adhesive investigated here demonstrated a compelling safety profile and significant clinical efficacy to stop air leaks after lung resections. We conclude that the routine use of a fixed quantity of fibrin glue is not effective in reducing the duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage, or hospitalization after uncomplicated pulmonary lobectomy. Systematic use of BioGlue may be warranted in adult thoracic surgical procedures (except pneumonectomy and decortication) when an air leak remains after all other steps to control it have failed. Further studies with this and other methods are required to delineate routine versus selective use, to compare methods, and clarify cost benefit. This reduction in air leakage resulted in a significant reduction in both the time to chest drain removal and the period of hospitalisation. Use of the sealant led to a reduction in postoperative air leaks, which may have decreased the length of hospitalization.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.875921905,"bertscore_r":0.8333531022,"bertscore_f":0.8541073799,"rouge1_p":0.4117647059,"rouge1_r":0.1147540984,"rouge1_f":0.1794871795,"rouge2_p":0.125,"rouge2_r":0.0333333333,"rouge2_f":0.0526315789,"rougeL_p":0.2352941176,"rougeL_r":0.0655737705,"rougeL_f":0.1025641026,"rougeLsum_p":0.2352941176,"rougeLsum_r":0.0655737705,"rougeLsum_f":0.1025641026,"ei_score":0.0130983129,"claimver":0.5723273754,"sts":0.7128266692,"nli":0.8055294752},"entities":[["fibrin glue","INT"],["intra - operative air leakage intensity and duration of postoperative air leakage","OUT"],["post surgical air leakage and drainage volumes","OUT"],["thoracic operations","PAR"],["thoracic surgical","PAR"],["efficacy","OUT"],["duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage, or hospitalization","OUT"],["lung sealant","INT"],["adverse drug event","OUT"],["aal empyema","OUT"],["alveolar air leak","OUT"],["postoperative air leaks hospitalization","OUT"],["air leakage time to chest drain removal and the period of hospitalisation","OUT"],["vivostat fibrin sealant","INT"],["hospitalization and cost benefits","OUT"],["duration post - operative drainage","OUT"],["bioglue","INT"],["postoperative air leaks","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of fibrin glue for the prevention of air leaks after lung resections.

A potentiating effect of corticosteroids on the beta-adrenergic responsiveness is a possible explanation for the advantage of this combined treatment in the management of acute wheezing in infancy. Although there appears to be an age-dependent degree of response, metaproterenol is effective in relieving the respiratory distress of young acutely wheezing children, including those with documented respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. Copyright 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel. However, the nebulized bronchodilator treatments were more effective than aminophylline IV in decreasing scores on the first day, and they resulted in shorter hospitalization. Oral salbutamol is not superior to placebo in reducing the duration of symptoms in mild cases of acute bronchiolitis in children. We conclude that nebulized albuterol constitutes a safe and effective treatment of infants with bronchiolitis. The widespread use of oral albuterol in this patient group is not recommended. Based on these results, we do not recommend routine use of either nebulized EPI or ALB in this patient group. In a double blind randomised trial, we found no evidence that nebulised ipratropium bromide was of clinical benefit in acute bronchiolitis. Salbutamol was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc. This study supports the use of nebulized albuterol in the treatment of wheezing infants in the emergency department. 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Nebulized albuterol in infants with mild bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus did not improve VPTEF\/VE and tPTEF\/tE but did decrease TEF10 and 25\/PT. Nebulized albuterol therapy does not appear to enhance recovery or attenuate severity of illness in infants hospitalized with acute, moderate bronchiolitis, as evidenced by improvement in oxygen saturation, time to meet standardized discharge criteria, or length of hospital stay. The use of bronchodilators did not alter the course of the disease and is therefore not effective in the treatment of bronchiolitis. Inhaled bronchodilators did not improve the condition of hospitalised mild bronchiolitis. Routine nebulised aerosol sympathomimetic treatment during acute bronchiolitis cannot be recommended. We conclude that salbutamol is safe and effective for the initial treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis. Thus the benefit of bronchodilator treatment in these patients is small, does not differ among the drugs we studied and of questionable value. It is concluded that there is no role for the nebulized bronchodilators Salbutamol and Ipratropium bromide, either as a single agent or in combination, compared with normal saline placebo in treating young children in hospital with bronchiolitis.

Breast feeding effectively reduces response to pain during minor invasive procedure in term neonates. Further studies are needed. Breastfeeding is a potent analgesic intervention in newborns during a standard blood collection. The orosensorial antinociceptive effect of human milk is not as effective as an analgesic as a 25% sucrose solution. This study has confirmed some well known information that breast feeding and oral sucrose solution have pain reducing effects in infants undergoing venipuncture. The combination of oral glucose and breast-feeding shows the lowest pain score and significantly shorter duration of crying. \u00a9 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. In contrast, glycine tends to increase pain reaction whereas breast milk has no effect. Breast milk and 10% glucose did not have a similar effect. A calm or sleeping state before a painful procedure also appears to decrease crying and pain scores. The conclusion was that breastfeeding was effective in reducing pain caused by blood collection for newborn screening. Breastfeeding in the 1st 2 postnatal days with skin-to-skin contact did not increase the analgesic effect of skin-to-skin contact alone. Feeding and breastfeeding during heel-lancing were found to be the most effective methods of pain relief. The implications of this dissociation are discussed. It is concluded that neither foremilk nor hindmilk is superior in relieving pain when compared to placebo. Feeding 5 ml of EBM before venepuncture is effective in reducing symptoms due to pain in term neonates.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8417011499,"bertscore_r":0.836404562,"bertscore_f":0.8390445113,"rouge1_p":0.1923076923,"rouge1_r":0.0961538462,"rouge1_f":0.1282051282,"rouge2_p":0.0,"rouge2_r":0.0,"rouge2_f":0.0,"rougeL_p":0.1153846154,"rougeL_r":0.0576923077,"rougeL_f":0.0769230769,"rougeLsum_p":0.1153846154,"rougeLsum_r":0.0576923077,"rougeLsum_f":0.0769230769,"ei_score":0.9955869176,"claimver":0.4798769951,"sts":0.4738100767,"nli":0.4788876176},"entities":[["breastfeeding","INT"],["glycine","INT"],["term neonates","PAR"],["pain relief","OUT"],["infants undergoing venipuncture","PAR"],["placebo","INT"],["newborns","PAR"],["breast feeding","INT"],["glucose","INT"],["pain","OUT"],["ebm","INT"],["crying and pain scores","OUT"],["pain score duration of crying","OUT"],["analgesic effect","OUT"],["analgesia","OUT"],["sucrose","INT"],["response pain","OUT"],["foremilk hindmilk","INT"],["pain reaction","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of sucrose for the prevention of pain during blood sampling.

Oral dosing at higher levels or parenteral administration of cyclosporine have not been adequately evaluated in controlled clinical trials.

The results of this trial establish the efficacy of intravenous heparin in the treatment of proximal venous thrombosis and suggest a relation between the effectiveness of heparin and the levels of anticoagulation achieved; such a relation could explain the observed failure of the subcutaneous regimen. Two major, non-fatal pulmonary emboli occurred, one in each group. Subcutaneous UFH with dose adjusted by activated partial thromboplastin time by means of a weight-based algorithm is as effective and safe as fixed-dose nadroparin for the initial treatment of patients with VTE, including those with pulmonary embolism and recurrent VTE. It is concluded that subcutaneous fixed dose Fraxiparine is safe and at least as effective as subcutaneous adjusted UFH in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. The results showed that subcutaneous injections of sodium heparin are as effective and safe as continuous intravenous infusion of this drug in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00182403. We conclude that subcutaneous heparin treatment with UH or LH appears safe and convenient. Thromboembolic complications occurred with both methods of treatment when anticoagulation was ineffective. Conclusion: Adjusted subcutaneous calcium heparin may be an effective and safe alternative to continuous intravenous calcium heparin in the initial treatment of acute proximal deep vein thrombosis. However, low molecular weight heparin seemed to be safer than standard heparin. This study showed that subcutaneous calcium heparin was more effective in helping lyse existing thrombus and preventing its propagation than intravenous sodium heparin. To the same conclusion points an overview of the seven randomized trials which compared these treatment modalities. This study indicated that LMWH and SCHep can be used safely and effectively to treat patients with proximal DVT at home at a lower cost.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8833451867,"bertscore_r":0.8132753968,"bertscore_f":0.846863389,"rouge1_p":0.64,"rouge1_r":0.1,"rouge1_f":0.172972973,"rouge2_p":0.2916666667,"rouge2_r":0.0440251572,"rouge2_f":0.0765027322,"rougeL_p":0.4,"rougeL_r":0.0625,"rougeL_f":0.1081081081,"rougeLsum_p":0.4,"rougeLsum_r":0.0625,"rougeLsum_f":0.1081081081,"ei_score":0.1240552549,"claimver":0.642621994,"sts":0.6207883954,"nli":0.7351021767},"entities":[["major, non - fatal pulmonary emboli","OUT"],["ufh","INT"],["safer","OUT"],["patients with proximal dvt","PAR"],["thromboembolic complications","OUT"],["nadroparin","INT"],["calcium heparin","INT"],["heparin","INT"],["subcutaneous calcium heparin calcium heparin","INT"],["safe","OUT"],["patients with vte including those with pulmonary embolism and recurrent vte","PAR"],["molecular weight heparin","INT"],["effective safe","OUT"],["deep vein thrombosis","PAR"],["thrombus","OUT"],["sodium heparin","INT"],["fraxiparine","INT"],["lmwh schep","INT"],["uh lmwh","INT"],["safe convenient","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of heparin for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

The effect of the drug on survival remains to be determined. In conclusion, long-term treatment with pimobendan significantly lowered morbidity and improved the physical activity of patients with mild to moderate CHF. Drugs that improve symptoms in severe end stage heart failure should not be discarded lightly. The mechanism by which the drug exerts its deleterious effects is unknown. Twelve weeks of treatment with low-dose enoximone improves exercise capacity in patients with CHF, without increasing adverse events. The balance between benefit and risk of treatment with this compound remains to be established however. The aetiology and diuretic requirement of patients may influence their response to treatment. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) A short-term benefit in terms of the quality of life raises issues about the appropriate therapeutic goal in treating heart failure. This study failed to demonstrate that imazodan provided any benefit in exercise performance when compared with placebo. However, because recent evidence indicates that the flosequinan dose studied in the present trial has an adverse effect on survival, the benefit-to-risk ratio must be assessed in individual patients. However, a higher dose of vesnarinone (120 mg per day) increased mortality, suggesting that this drug has a narrow therapeutic range; the long-term effects of vesnarinone are unknown. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Pimobendan appears to be useful adjunctive therapy when added to digitalis, diuretics, and vasodilators. Furthermore, our data suggest that milrinone may aggravate ventricular arrhythmias.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8901435733,"bertscore_r":0.8683945537,"bertscore_f":0.8791345954,"rouge1_p":0.4583333333,"rouge1_r":0.1746031746,"rouge1_f":0.2528735632,"rouge2_p":0.1304347826,"rouge2_r":0.0483870968,"rouge2_f":0.0705882353,"rougeL_p":0.4583333333,"rougeL_r":0.1746031746,"rougeL_f":0.2528735632,"rougeLsum_p":0.4583333333,"rougeLsum_r":0.1746031746,"rougeLsum_f":0.2528735632,"ei_score":0.030774443,"claimver":0.3812476397,"sts":0.5067793131,"nli":0.5623090267},"entities":[["patients with chf","PAR"],["enoximone","INT"],["ventricular arrhythmias","OUT"],["imazodan","INT"],["pimobendan","INT"],["exercise capacity","OUT"],["survival","OUT"],["flosequinan","INT"],["vesnarinone","INT"],["life","OUT"],["exercise performance","OUT"],["milrinone","INT"],["placebo","INT"],["mortality","OUT"],["hemodynamic parameters of left - ventricular performance","OUT"],["end stage heart failure","PAR"],["patients with mild to moderate chf","PAR"],["morbidity physical activity","OUT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the addition of an inotropic agent to standard care improves survival or quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure.

The use of azathioprine may be advised in patients with contraindications to the radical Graves' disease treatment and in prophylaxis of its complications. Moreover after a 3-year follow-up the remission rate of high dose (60.3%) is not different from which is obtained with intermediate one (20 to 30 mg\/d) associated with a permanent decrease of TSH by thyroid hormone. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) This study has found that, in Spanish patients, the use of high doses of carbimazole with T4 offers no advantages in the treatment of GD hyperthyroidism. The administration of thyroxine during antithyroid drug treatment decreases both the production of antibodies to TSH receptors and the frequency of recurrence of hyperthyroidism. However, it leads to more frequent side-effects than conventional dose treatment. The administration of T4 to patients with Graves' disease during carbimazole treatment and after its withdrawal neither delays nor prevents the recurrence of hyperthyroidism. We conclude that the addition of T4 to methimazole does not improve long-term remission rates in Graves' disease. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) However, due to the relatively small number of smoking patients in the present cohort, this conclusion needs to be confirmed by a larger study. High TRAb levels and goiter weight at the end of ATD treatment may hint at recurrence. The present study suggests that antithyroid drugs treatment can be terminated more appropriately when both the serum TSH level and TBII activity are made normal, thus avoiding prolonged and unnecessary drug treatment. However, the relapse rates in both groups, and the number of side-effects in the high-dose group, were unacceptably high. Concomitantly, no predictor of recurrence of disease could be identified, irrespective of treatment modality. Only the size of goiter on initiation of treatment may be a prognostic factor for disease evolution. Smoking, large goiter and presence of TRAb at the end of ATD therapy were strong predictors of relapse. These results show that six months treatment with a block-replace regimen of antithyroid drugs is probably sufficient, in the UK, to achieve maximum remission of Graves' disease and that there are no HLA markers which clearly predict outcome. These findings would indicate that, when a defined duration treatment is planned, prolonging treatment beyond 18 months does not provide any additional benefit. This will provide the same chance of remission as higher doses, and provide the best balance of risk and benefit. However, our data suggest that TSH suppressive treatment may have a beneficial effect on thyroid enlargement in Graves' disease.

The immune responses among vaccine recipients ranged from 60% in 3-year-olds to 81% for 6-year-olds. The results of the follow-up indicate that, in the dosage schedule used, the Ty21a mutant strain, found previously to be stable and safe, is protective against typhoid fever for at least one year. The antibody responses and the efficacy suggest that this vaccine should be at least as protective in persons who are more than five years old. Ty21a may now be regarded as a practical public health tool. Primary and booster immunizations with the Vi vaccines are well tolerated in healthy adults; mean Vi antibody levels remain significantly elevated for up to 34 months after primary immunization. The slightly higher dose of vaccine did not seem to alter efficacy significantly in China. Surveillance continues to determine the duration of Vi-induced immunity. Thus, the liquid formulation of Ty21a is preferable to enteric-coated capsules. We believe Vi vaccine may serve as a vaccine of new generation to be promoted. Vi CPS is thus a safe and effective means of typhoid vaccination. Under conditions of intense transmission, Ty21a protected against typhoid fever; however, because Ty21a will not protect all individuals, there is a need for additional approaches to prevent the disease.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.8838278055,"bertscore_r":0.8551763296,"bertscore_f":0.8692660332,"rouge1_p":0.338028169,"rouge1_r":0.2823529412,"rouge1_f":0.3076923077,"rouge2_p":0.0428571429,"rouge2_r":0.0357142857,"rouge2_f":0.038961039,"rougeL_p":0.2394366197,"rougeL_r":0.2,"rougeL_f":0.2179487179,"rougeLsum_p":0.2394366197,"rougeLsum_r":0.2,"rougeLsum_f":0.2179487179,"ei_score":0.0853005626,"claimver":0.849339366,"sts":0.7632324696,"nli":0.8100498319},"entities":[["tolerated","OUT"],["mean vi antibody levels","OUT"],["healthy adults","PAR"],["efficacy","OUT"],["immune responses","OUT"],["ty21","INT"],["persons who are more than five years old","PAR"],["vi cps","INT"],["antibody responses efficacy","OUT"],["vaccine","INT"],["ty21a","INT"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is no evidence that typhoid vaccines are effective in preventing typhoid fever.

However, the ADC did have significantly greater sedative effects than did placebo. We conclude that there is no clinically significant improvement in symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, including no significant placebo effect, in young children for whom an antihistamine-decongestant is prescribed. The results indicate that codeine, either as a single 30-mg dose or in a total daily dose of 120 mg, is no more effective than the syrup vehicle in controlling cough associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection. Terfenadine was found to be ineffective in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of the common cold. An antitussive combined with a beta 2-sympathomimetic might be the most effective treatment in this type of cough. We conclude that the cough of the common cold arose from upper respiratory tract stimuli and that cough and other cardinal symptoms of the common cold were reduced with antihistamine-decongestant therapy when these symptoms were at their worst. The results also demonstrate that the sound-level meter appears to be a potentially useful investigative tool for the assessment of cough and antitussive efficacy. There were no differences between groups for the frequency of drowsiness. The results confirm the multisymptom benefit of a single dose of the test syrup containing paracetamol, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, doxylamine succinate and ephedrine sulfate and support its role as an effective and convenient therapy for symptoms of nasal congestion, runny nose, cough and pain\/body aches associated with the common cold and for increasing sleep quality disturbed by the common cold. The diurnal variation in cough frequency measured by the tape recording was not apparent from the subjective cough frequency estimates obtained by the questionnaire. Each clinician should consider these findings, the potential for adverse effects, and the individual and cumulative costs of the drugs before recommending them to families.

Also, antibiotics had no statistically significant effect on mortality and length of hospital stay in inpatients and almost no data on patient-reported outcomes exist.

(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) These results were concordant with the overall clinical assessment made by the specialist in charge. The investigational drug was found to be well tolerated. In this period, about two-thirds of the patients on Ginkgo-biloba, and about one-fifth of the patients on placebo showed improvements. Inter-group differences in the ADAS cognitive and non-cognitive subscales did not reach statistical significance, probably because of the small sample size. Conclusions: Treatment with ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 improves mental\/mnestic performance. It could be confirmed that, in patients with moderate dementia, short-term intravenous infusion therapy with EGb 761 results in an improvement of psychopathology and cognitive performance, which is reflected in an increased ability to cope with the demands of daily living.

When heparin is contraindicated ancrod is an effective and safe alternative. High fibrinogen levels could thus be a risk for perioperative thrombosis. Following autologous vein bypass surgery in the treated group, the results were superior in terms of graft patency, limb salvage, and survival. The long-term administration of warfarin therapy when combined with aspirin therapy has only a few selected indications for improvement of bypass patency and is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. dextran 70 and the low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin have the same effect on 90 days femorodistal graft patency, but care must be taken using the dextran to patients with a potential heart insufficiency. Based on additional case histories in these patients with hypercoagulability, it is suggested that fibrinogen is a risk factor for thromboembolic complications and that a combination of low dose of heparin and AT might be an effective regimen to prevent intraoperative thrombosis with a low risk of haemorrhage.","annotations":[],"scores":{"bertscore_p":0.924146533,"bertscore_r":0.8627799153,"bertscore_f":0.8924095035,"rouge1_p":0.5294117647,"rouge1_r":0.1323529412,"rouge1_f":0.2117647059,"rouge2_p":0.0625,"rouge2_r":0.0149253731,"rouge2_f":0.0240963855,"rougeL_p":0.4117647059,"rougeL_r":0.1029411765,"rougeL_f":0.1647058824,"rougeLsum_p":0.4117647059,"rougeLsum_r":0.1029411765,"rougeLsum_f":0.1647058824,"ei_score":0.0704578937,"claimver":0.6385948658,"sts":0.5989643931,"nli":0.617900908},"entities":[["heparin at","INT"],["warfarin therapy aspirin","INT"],["graft patency, limb salvage, and survival","OUT"],["rate wound hematomas","OUT"],["coumarin","INT"],["low molecular weight heparin","INT"],["thrombosis bleeding or hemorrhagic complications","OUT"],["heparin","INT"],["lmwh ufh","INT"],["patency rate limb salvage rate","OUT"],["bypass patency morbidity mortality","OUT"],["ancrod","INT"],["warfarin","INT"],["bypass","INT"],["intraoperative thrombosis","OUT"],["dextran 70 heparin enoxaparin","INT"],["patients with a potential heart insufficiency","PAR"],["##odistal graft patency","OUT"],["patients at high risk for graft failure","PAR"]]},{"exp_short":"8FWF5T","prediction":"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of anticoagulants for vascular surgery.

It is concluded NNS is safe, efficacious and a viable alternative treatment for smoking cessation. This is however a post-hoc finding and should be taken with caution. Continuous, structured, and composite efforts are needed for the maintenance of the non-smoking behavior. Short TNS treatment (3 weeks) is at least as effective as a longer one (6 weeks), which is relevant both medically and economically. However, in conjunction with previous pre-cessation trials there appears to be a moderate benefit, but not as large as that seen in most smaller trials. Combination nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches were delivered safely in a nonspecialized outpatient clinical setting and enhanced short-term smoking abstinence rates, but these rates were not sustained at 6 months. Higher-dose (44-mg) nicotine replacement does not appear to be indicated for general clinical populations, although it may provide short-term benefit to some smokers attempting to quit with minimal adjuvant treatment. Until larger trials are completed, however, the possibility that this dose of nicotine gum may produce small beneficial effects cannot be excluded. We concluded that transdermal nicotine, when used as an adjunct to low-intervention therapy, significantly reduced tobacco withdrawal symptoms and enhanced smoking cessation rates. Abstinence rates were higher with combination therapy than with bupropion alone, but the difference was not statistically significant. Duration of counseling, patient age, and Fagerstrom scores may be important factors related to the long-term smoking cessation success of nicotine patch therapy. Ethnicity, weight, and level of nicotine dependence may help identify smokers who have greater or lesser abstinence rates with either transdermal or nasal spray nicotine. We conclude that, when used in a nonselected group of smokers along with a brief intervention in a general medical practice, the pharmacologic effects of nicotine gum to increase cessation are either small or nonexistent. Other mild, transient, systemic side effects reported by 33.9% of the TNS and 26.8% of the placebo users (n. s.) did not lead to drop-outs. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. Cost-benefit estimates suggest that an insurance plan, HMO, etc., would recoup any costs in subsidizing nicotine gum and perhaps incur a net financial gain. National Institutes of Health. In hospital patients NRT, given as regular daily patches plus an inhalator to be used as needed, did not add to the smoking cessation rate achieved at 1 year by regular advice and support, despite significantly increasing the cessation rate at 1 week. Future efforts should focus on increasing adherence to behavioral program components, particularly session attendance. Treatment with the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch resulted in significantly higher cessation rates than inhaler plus placebo patch. These results call into question the utility of cue exposure treatment for smoking relapse prevention. Thus, when nicotine-replacement therapy is provided, a need exists for concurrent behavioral intervention and training for prevention of a relapse, neither of which was part of this protocol. Smokers with lower baseline nicotine and cotinine levels had better cessation rates, which provides indirect evidence that they had more adequate nicotine replacement with this fixed dose of transdermal nicotine than those smokers with higher baseline levels. The results of the study are discussed in terms of strategies that might improve the success of treatment-matching approaches with newer forms of nicotine replacement therapies. The transdermal nicotine patch is effective when used as an adjunct to a group cognitive-behavioural intervention and it provides relief from withdrawal symptoms associated with nicotine dependence. Examination of 132 self-selecting patients who fully participated in the three interventions and attended all scheduled visits, revealed significantly larger proportions of abstainers within Groups SBCN (34%) and SBC (33%) than in Group AN (15%) at the 12-month follow-up. NRT given with brief counselling to hospital inpatients is an effective routine smoking cessation intervention. The results indicate that the transdermal nicotine patch is an effective aid in smoking cessation programs. The present study shows no difference between physician versus nurse counseling and no improvement in the proportion of quitters with the addition of nicotine gum in the physician-counseled group. The rate of success in this group was 25.8%, without statistically significant difference with the first group. However, it did not produce the expected effect on weight, thereby restricting our ability to examine the effect of weight control on smoking cessation and relapse. Treatment of smokers with NI and SA should be restricted to smoking types in which an effect superior to PL is documented, and research should be performed to find support for smoking types where SA and NI have a clear effect. In conclusion, the use of nicotine nasal spray significantly increased the abstinence rate during the first 6 months following the quitting day. The low percentage of participants using the nasal spray at 1 year, and the few relapses during the second year, suggest that it is not cost effective to use a nasal spray for longer than 7 months after stopping a patch. Long-term cessation may require extended maintenance procedures and\/or an identification of optimal gum use. Results of this study were consistent with results of larger trials of smokers without alcohol problems, showing that combination therapy (nicotine patch plus gum) is more effective than monotherapy (nicotine patch) for smoking cessation. With a longer active follow-up period than was used here (1 month), even better results may be possible. We compare this result with others achieved in general practice. Nicotine mouth spray delivered significantly higher 6-, 24- and 52-week continuous abstinence rates than placebo. The gum was well accepted by patients and gave no serious side effects. Determination of plasma cotinine values may be, thus, helpful in identifying smokers who could benefit from transdermal nicotine replacement. After a one-year follow-up period, the success rates were in the same order of magnitude for nicotine gum (active treatment: 10%, placebo: 8%) group and for acupuncture (active treatment: 8%, placebo: 10%) group. Nicotine patches had no influence on smoking cessation during pregnancy, although they might increase birth weight in comparison with placebo. Nicotine gum schedule had no effect on treatment outcome. To conclude, the set-up investigated in this study which included minimal behavioural support with nicotine patches should be evaluated in other lung clinics, as it doubled success rate when compared to a placebo with a 1-yr point prevalence of 16% and also the resources used are limited. Efforts should be made to reach underserved populations through smoking cessation programs, and to assist in maintaining abstinence. NRT should be used to aid cessation in all smokers with COPD, regardless of disease severity and number of cigarettes smoked. These findings demonstrate that smokers who wish to quit smoking by gradual reduction can increase their success by using nicotine gum to facilitate reduction and cessation. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. The results of this trial do not support the routine use of higher dose nicotine patch therapy in the treatment of nicotine dependence. Future research should focus primarily on investigating ways to improve smoking quit rates for smokers in early alcohol recovery. The coping behavior of the BTP group may have been more effective than that of the BT group, as indicated by their significantly higher level of self-efficacy. Additionally, the nicotine patch provides relief from some tobacco withdrawal symptoms. Use of nicotine polacrilex gum, therefore, can substantially aid in stopping smoking, particularly among highly dependent smokers. The clinical importance of these findings is discussed. Although nicotine replacement therapy has improved our ability to produce smoking cessation, the production of sustained, longer term abstinence remains an elusive goal. The nicotine inhaler was an effective smoking cessation aid that produced a few mild and transient adverse effects. The patches were generally well tolerated, although 25% of subjects in the nicotine group and 13% in the placebo group had transient local erythema after application of the patch; 5 members of the nicotine group withdrew because of poor cutaneous tolerance. The suggestion that TNS produces an increase of 50% in relative terms (7% absolute increase) in smoking cessation over placebo in this population of hospital patients is sufficiently strong to warrant a further study large enough to answer whether or not this result was due to chance. The nicotine lozenge is a safe and effective new treatment for smoking cessation in low- and high-dependence smokers. Although no smokers relapsed to alcohol use, a trial that follows up all subjects is needed to verify this. The nicotine patch is efficacious in smoking cessation over a 6-month period, when combined with only self-help materials, three brief visits, and telephone counseling. However, efforts are needed to improve long-term abstinence rates and smoking outcomes among women with a history of depression. While the nicotine lozenge, bupropion, and bupropion plus lozenge produced effects that were comparable with those reported in previous research, the nicotine patch plus lozenge produced the greatest benefit relative to placebo for smoking cessation. Although nicotine gum did not increase quit rates, use of nicotine gum increased birth weight and gestational age, two key parameters in predicting neonatal wellbeing. The nicotine pre-treatment was equally effective in light and heavy smokers. Adding active gum use to active patch use in subjects smoking 10 cigarettes or more a day increased abstinence rates, which are statistically significant up to 24 weeks. In summary, a higher than standard dose of nicotine patch was associated with an increase in the long-term success in smoking cessation but continuation of treatment beyond 8-12 weeks did not increase the success rates. The nicotine sublingual tablet increased the smoking cessation rate compared to placebo, reduced craving in highly dependent smokers and was well tolerated. By 6 months most of the non-smokers had relapsed, but the nicotine gum group (23%) was more successful than the placebo (5% or the control group (14%). Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. However, the efficacy of transdermal nicotine as an aid to smoking cessation in such patients is limited and may not be sustained over time. Studies are needed to assess other interventions that may further improve quit rates among African American light smokers who are motivated to quit. Additional study of nicotine gum, with enhanced instructional support, is needed to assess its efficacy among adolescent smokers. Thus, NCG does appear to have a role in family practice for promoting short-term cessation. ). The likelihood of severe reactions at the site of application with repeated treatment is low. Consistent with earlier work, the study provided further support for the relationship between nicotine replacement level and post-cessation weight gain. Lack of power, contamination, and low attendance at reinforcing sessions should be taken into account in interpreting the results. However, the absolute rate of abstinence after one year was only 17 percent, which is lower than the rate in studies that have combined the use of nicotine chewing gum with behavioral therapy. Reduction with or without nicotine substitution may be a feasible first step towards smoking cessation in people not able or not willing to stop abruptly. Nicotine gum is an effective adjunct to minimal-contact smoking cessation materials plus monetary incentive in a population-based sample of smokers. In the absence of a placebo gum control group, expectancy cannot be eliminated as a possible explanation of the short-term results. OTC nicotine inhaler appears to be ineffective, though quit rates are improved with HCP assistance. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00296647. These results compare favorably with those reported from the more recent nicotine patch therapy. Self-reports of pretreatment craving predicted response to the nicotine exposure treatments. The study has implications for identifying the treatment needs of lighter smokers. Nicotine chewing gum is effective in improving the success rates in smoking cessation based on group therapy. The use of nicotine gum in appropriate doses should be helpful to persons who are attempting to stop smoking. Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake. History-positive smokers may be best treated by interventions providing additional support and contact, independent of therapeutic content. Mecamylamine before smoking cessation may be an effective adjunct to nicotine patch therapy. Starting nicotine gum treatment 4 weeks before the target quit date was no more effective than starting treatment on the quit date. Agonist-antagonist therapy, consisting of the nicotine patch with oral mecamylamine, may substantially improve current smoking cessation treatment. We conclude that research on different gum chewing regimens is warranted and that further examination of possible gender differences in response to replacement therapy is needed. Among reducers, the toxin intake correlated with reduced cigarette consumption although some compensatory smoking occurred. In view of these findings and similar results from previous studies, current labeling of the nicotine patch, which recommends using nicotine replacement therapy only after the quit date, should be reexamined. Few side effects were reported. All rights reserved. The results of the present study provide no support for the use of naltrexone, alone or in combination with nicotine patches, as a therapeutic treatment for smoking cessation. Our results, although not yet verified by long-term observations, demonstrate that transdermal nicotine substitution significantly enhances the effectiveness of behavioral smoking cessation methods. All but one of the 96 subjects eventually achieving long-term abstinence in the study quit during the first week of cessation. Nicotine nasal spray in combination with group treatment is an effective aid to smoking cessation. The value of nicotine chewing gum, if any, can be quite small when it is used in general practice. The authors conclude that fixed-dose transdermal nicotine, tapered-dose transdermal nicotine, and buspirone are associated with similar efficacy and safety when combined with behavior modification in smoking cessation. No significant differences in smoking cessation rates were seen among smokers who started with the low-dose nicotine or placebo patches.

Methyl aminolevulinate PDT is an effective treatment for nodular BCC, and while there is a trend for higher recurrence with this modality, it conveys the advantage over surgery of better cosmesis. Thus, in the treatment of BCC of the face of less than 4 cm in diameter, surgery should be preferred to radiotherapy. Topical 5% imiquimod cream is well tolerated and most effective in treating nodular BCC when applied once daily for 7 days per week for either 12 or 6 weeks. Occlusion did not have a statistically significant effect on efficacy for either superficial or nodular BCC tumours. These results suggest that IFN alfa-2a, 2b, and the combination of 2a and 2b appear to be effective choices for the treatment of BCC; the effectiveness is not increased by their combination. Imiquimod 5% cream administered 7 x\/week for 6 weeks is a safe and effective treatment for sBCC when compared with vehicle cream. A single course of verteporfin PDT showed treatment benefit for patients with multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers. A sustained-release protamine zinc preparation of interferon alfa-2b shows promise as a practical, effective, and cosmetically elegant treatment for basal cell carcinoma. Although the study was unable to detect any statistically significant differences in outcome between the study groups, this small pilot study shows preliminary findings which may indicate an increase in the short-term eradication of BCC using a PC-based vehicle as compared to conventional petrolatum-based formulations. For some patients with noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas, intralesional interferon alfa-2b may be an alternative, effective treatment. Results demonstrate that treatment of BCC with 5-FU\/epi gel is both safe and effective, may result in histologically confirmed complete response rates comparable to surgery, and provides a nonsurgical treatment alternative in selected patients. It is concluded that cryotherapy does not offer a satisfactory alternative to radiotherapy in the treatment of basal-cell carcinomas. Daily or 5 times a week dosing for 12 weeks demonstrated high efficacy results with acceptable safety profiles. The 5x\/week regimen is recommended. Cost and safety are further elements in favor of the BL in this setting. Although recurrence rates were lower after MMS than after SE, the differences were not significant.

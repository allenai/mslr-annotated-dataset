205186000	longformer_predictions	BACKGROUND Current guidelines recommend that patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) should be treated with systemic corticosteroid for seven to 14 days . Intermittent systemic corticosteroid use is cumulatively associated with adverse effects such as osteoporosis , hyperglycaemia and muscle weakness . Shorter treatment could reduce adverse effects . OBJECTIVES To compare the efficacy of short- duration ( seven or fewer days ) and conventional longer- duration ( longer than seven days ) systemic corticosteroid treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD .	Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of oral corticosteroids is likely to be sufficient for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD , and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroids ( of around five days ) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer ( 10 to 14 days ) courses .

This systematic review including meta- analysis was aim ed to evaluate whether differences in terms of antibody titers against P. gingivalis exist between RA patients and systemically healthy individuals with and without PD . Material s and methods The following focused question was addressed : Are the antibody titers against P. gingivalis of RA patients different from systemically healthy individuals with and without PD ?	The present findings indicate that RA is often accompanied by the presence of an immune response against P. gingivalis . Clinical relevance The significantly higher antibody response to P. gingivalis in comparison to systemically healthy individuals supports the link between PD and RA by P. gingivalis .

78091788	longformer_predictions	Background Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) that specifically inhibits tumor-associated bone lysis through the RANKL pathway and has been used as neoadjuvant therapy for giant-cell tumor of bone ( GCTB ) in surgical as well as non-surgical cases . The purpose of this systematic review of the literature , therefore , is to investigate : ( 1 ) demographic characteristics of patients affected by GCTBs treated with denosumab and the clinical impact , as well as , possible complications associated with its use ( 2 ) oncological outcomes in terms of local recurrence rate ( LRR ) and development of lung metastasis , and ( 3 ) characteristics of its treatment effect in terms of clinical , radiological , and histological response .	The use of denosumab as an adjuvant treatment of GCTB has shown a positive but variable histological response with consistent radiological changes and several types of adverse effects . There is a positive clinical response in terms of pain relief with decrease on the morbidity of surgical procedures to be performed . Finally , oncological outcomes are disparate with neither effect on metastatic disease nor local recurrence rates .

5366917	longformer_predictions	Abstract Patients with early‐stage non – small‐cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) who are unable to undergo surgery can be offered radiation therapy ( RT ) . Previously , conventional RT was offered ; however , newer techniques such as stereotactic body RT ( SBRT ) have become available . The objective of the present systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness of RT with curative intent in patients with early‐stage medically inoperable NSCLC .	The evidence suggests that SBRT compared with observation or other forms of RT , such as accelerated hypofractionated RT , 3‐dimensional conformal RT , conventional fractionated RT , external beam RT , proton beam therapy , and carbon ion therapy , could have similar or improved results in survival or local control , with similar or fewer adverse effects . Evidence also suggests that local tumor control and survival were associated with the biologically effective dose ( BED ) for SBRT .	The results of this systematic review suggest that SBRT is an effective treatment option for patients with early‐stage medically inoperable NSCLC.	2: Yes--there are no errors that impact comprehension of the summary	2: Yes	2: Yes	2: Yes		(+1): Positive effect	(+1): Positive effect		2: Moderate claim	2: Moderate claim

40428394	longformer_predictions	BACKGROUND Anaemia is a frequent condition during pregnancy , particularly among women in low- and middle-income countries . Traditionally , gestational anaemia has been prevented with daily iron supplements throughout pregnancy , but adherence to this regimen due to side effects , interrupted supply of the supplements , and concerns about safety among women with an adequate iron intake , have limited the use of this intervention . Intermittent ( i.e. two or three times a week on non-consecutive days ) supplementation has been proposed as an alternative to daily supplementation . OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits and harms of intermittent supplementation with iron alone or in combination with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals to pregnant women on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes .	Findings suggest that intermittent regimens produced similar maternal and infant outcomes as daily supplementation but were associated with fewer side effects and reduced the risk of high levels of Hb in mid and late pregnancy , although the risk of mild anaemia near term was increased . While the quality of the evidence was assessed as low or very low , intermittent may be a feasible alternative to daily iron supplementation among those pregnant women who are not anaemic and have adequate antenatal care	The is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intermittent iron supplements in pregnancy.

218490959	bart_predictions	BACKGROUND Permanent compliance of self-care behaviors is a challenging issue in managing chronic diseases like diabetes . The evidence supports theory-based intervention in promoting self-care behaviors . However , no systematic review was done to monitor these interventions and compare more effective constructs . This study was conducted to investigate the studies using self-care theories and introducing the most effective theories .	CONCLUSION Four theories appeared to be more effective for the target behavior of present research : Social Support Theory and the combination of Empowerment Theory and Health Belief Model , Social Cognitive Theory and Self Efficacy Theory . Taken together , the findings of this systematic review suggest that interventions that go beyond individual determinants ( such as changing knowledge and attitudes ) to determinants of upper cognitive , motor , and social levels ( such as the development of skills and competencies ) they have led to raised self-care outcomes	The-ory-based interventions were found to be effective in promoting self-care behaviors in patients with type 2 diabetes.												
15887960	bart_predictions	Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced cervix cancer has comparable benefits to concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) , but with fewer side effects . This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the management of locally advanced cervix cancer from stage IB2 ( tumor > 4.0 cm ) to IIIB ( tumor extending to the pelvic wall and /or hydronephrosis ) . Our primary objective was to assess benefits in terms of survival .	The most commonly used chemotherapies were cisplatin doublets . The treatment protocol was associated with a mild early toxicity profile . Leucopenia and neutropenia were the most common side effects . Late toxicity was also generally mild and mainly associated with bladder dysfunction and vaginal dehiscence . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieved comparable survival results to CCRT , and was associated with less toxicity	Theoadjuvant chemotherapy is a promising treatment option for the management of locally advanced cervix cancer in women.												
6781258	bart_predictions	BACKGROUND Childhood vaccination ( also described as immunisation ) is an important and effective way to reduce childhood illness and death . However , there are many children who do not receive the recommended vaccines because their parents do not know why vaccination is important , do not underst and how , where or when to get their children vaccinated , disagree with vaccination as a public health measure , or have concerns about vaccine safety . Face to face interventions to inform or educate parents about routine childhood vaccination may improve vaccination rates and parental knowledge or underst and ing of vaccination .

The antenatal period provides an opportunity to manage weight in pregnancy . This has the potential to reduce maternal and fetal complications associated with excess weight gain and obesity . OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of dietary and lifestyle interventions in reducing or preventing obesity in pregnancy and to assess the beneficial and adverse effects of the interventions on obstetric , fetal and neonatal outcomes .	There were no significant maternal or fetal adverse effects observed for the interventions in the included trials . There was high- quality evidence for small-for-gestational-age infants as an outcome . There was significant heterogeneity for the beneficial effect of diet on gestational weight gain . CONCLUSIONS Interventions in pregnancy to manage weight result in a significant reduction in weight gain in pregnancy ( evidence quality was moderate ) . Dietary interventions are the most effective type of intervention in pregnancy in reducing gestational weight gain and the risks of pre-eclampsia , gestational hypertension and shoulder dystocia . There is no evidence of harm as a result of the dietary and physical activity-based interventions in pregnancy .	The was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in maternal and neonatal outcomes.

270616	longformer_predictions	Introduction Approximately 11.1 million cancer survivors are alive in the United States . Activity prescriptions for cancer survivors rely on evidence as to whether exercise during or after treatment results in improved health outcomes . This systematic review and meta- analysis evaluates the extent to which physical activity during and post treatment is appropriate and effective across the cancer control continuum .	A small to moderate positive effect of physical activity during treatment was seen for physical activity level , aerobic fitness , muscular strength , functional quality of life , anxiety , and self-esteem . With few exceptions , exercise was well tolerated during and post treatment without adverse events . Conclusions Current evidence suggests many health benefits from physical activity during and post cancer treatments .	The, moderate to high-intensity aerobic exercise is associated with improved health outcomes in breast cancer survivors. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of exercise during or after treatment												
205189225	longformer_predictions	BACKGROUND Epithelial ovarian cancer accounts for about 90 % of all cases of ovarian cancer . Debulking surgery and six courses of platinum-based chemotherapy results in complete clinical remission ( CCR ) in up to 75 % of cases . However , 75 % of the responders will relapse within a median time of 18 to 28 months and only 20 % to 40 % of women will survive beyond five years . It has been suggested that maintenance chemotherapy could assist in prolonging remission . To date , there has not been a systematic review on the impact of maintenance chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer . OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness and toxicity of maintenance chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer and to evaluate the impact on quality of life ( QoL ) .	When all chemotherapy regimens were combined , meta- analysis indicated no significant difference in three- , five- and 10-year OS or PFS . AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS There is no evidence to suggest that the use of platinum agents , doxorubicin or paclitaxel used as maintenance chemotherapy is more effective than observation alone .	The results of this meta- analysis suggest that maintenance chemotherapy is not associated with an increased risk of CCR in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.

205191092	bart_predictions	BACKGROUND Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis . Although corticosteroids may improve symptoms , they have significant adverse effects . Steroids which act topically , with less systemic side-effects may be more desirable . Budesonide is a topically acting corticosteroid with extensive first pass hepatic metabolism . There are currently three formulations of budesonide : two st and ard formulations including a controlled-ileal release capsule and a pH-dependent capsule both design ed to release the drug in the distal small intestine and right colon ; and the newer Budesonide-MMX ® capsule design ed to release the drug throughout the entire colon . OBJECTIVES The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis .	Moderate quality evidence to supports the use of oral budesonide-MMX ® at a 9 mg daily dose for induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis , particularly in patients with left-sided colitis . Budesonide-MMX ® 9 mg daily is effective for induction of remission in the presence or absence of concurrent 5-ASA therapy . Further , budesonide-MMX ® appears to be safe , and does not lead to significant impairment of adrenocorticoid function compared to placebo . Moderate quality evidence from a single study suggests that mesalamine may be superior to st and ard budesonide for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis .	The is insufficient evidence to recommend oral budesonide for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.												
21845076	longformer_predictions	IMPORTANCE Human serum bactericidal antibody levels ( hSBA ) are commonly used as an immune correlate of protection after vaccination against meningococcal disease . We performed a systematic review of how well this marker correlates with protection induced by outer membrane vesicle ( OMV ) vaccines against meningococcal B ( MenB ) disease . OBJECTIVE To compare vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) of OMV vaccines against MenB predicted by hSBA ( predicted protection ) to VE from clinical studies ( observed protection ) .	In general , predicted VE tended to be lower than observed VE . CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE : hSBA induced by OMV vaccines correlates moderately well with protection against MenB in older children and adults . The correlation was poor at very young ages , for which low VE was observed	TheORS'CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of OMV vaccines against MenB disease.												
3272236	bart_predictions	BACKGROUND Cytotoxic chemotherapy has a limited place in the management of advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer . Commonly used agents include cisplatin and doxorubicin , but the side-effect profile may be unacceptable for many patients . The feasibility of administration of combination chemotherapy is limited in many patients on account of significant co-morbidity . While early-stage endometrial adenocarcinoma is a common gynaecological cancer with a favourable prognosis , advanced or recurrent disease presents a difficult management problem . The platinum and anthracycline compounds have been widely used for many years , but their impact on progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) is not clear . This systematic review aim ed to evaluate both the benefits and adverse effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy in these women .	OS was improved when doxorubicin , cisplatin and other drugs were compared with doxorubicin and cisplatin . Toxicity was generally higher with more chemotherapy . Platinums , anthracyclines and taxanes were the most studied in phase II trials and combinations gave the best responses , but patient selection and pre-treatment was very variable . CONCLUSIONS More intense combination chemotherapy significantly improves the disease-free survival and the data indicate a modest improvement in OS . The addition of anthracyclines ( e.g. doxorubicin ) or the taxanes [ e.g. paclitaxel ( Taxol ) ] to cisplatin increases the response rate . More intensive regimens are associated with the gain in survival . However , grade 3 and 4 myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity are also increased .	The results of this systematic review suggest that combination chemotherapy may be an effective treatment option for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.												
40428394	bart_predictions	BACKGROUND Anaemia is a frequent condition during pregnancy , particularly among women in low- and middle-income countries . Traditionally , gestational anaemia has been prevented with daily iron supplements throughout pregnancy , but adherence to this regimen due to side effects , interrupted supply of the supplements , and concerns about safety among women with an adequate iron intake , have limited the use of this intervention . Intermittent ( i.e. two or three times a week on non-consecutive days ) supplementation has been proposed as an alternative to daily supplementation . OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits and harms of intermittent supplementation with iron alone or in combination with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals to pregnant women on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes .	Findings suggest that intermittent regimens produced similar maternal and infant outcomes as daily supplementation but were associated with fewer side effects and reduced the risk of high levels of Hb in mid and late pregnancy , although the risk of mild anaemia near term was increased . While the quality of the evidence was assessed as low or very low , intermittent may be a feasible alternative to daily iron supplementation among those pregnant women who are not anaemic and have adequate antenatal care	The is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intermittent iron supplementation for the prevention of gestational anaemia

5366917	bart_predictions	Abstract Patients with early‐stage non – small‐cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) who are unable to undergo surgery can be offered radiation therapy ( RT ) . Previously , conventional RT was offered ; however , newer techniques such as stereotactic body RT ( SBRT ) have become available . The objective of the present systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness of RT with curative intent in patients with early‐stage medically inoperable NSCLC .	The evidence suggests that SBRT compared with observation or other forms of RT , such as accelerated hypofractionated RT , 3‐dimensional conformal RT , conventional fractionated RT , external beam RT , proton beam therapy , and carbon ion therapy , could have similar or improved results in survival or local control , with similar or fewer adverse effects . Evidence also suggests that local tumor control and survival were associated with the biologically effective dose ( BED ) for SBRT .	The results of this systematic review suggest that SBRT is effective in patients with early-stage medically inoperable NSCLC.

Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) guidance recommends treatment with adalimumab , etanercept and golimumab in adults with active ( severe ) AS only if certain criteria are fulfilled but it does not recommend infliximab for AS . Anti-TNFs for patients with nr-AxSpA have not previously been appraised by NICE . OBJECTIVE To determine the clinical effectiveness , safety and cost-effectiveness within the NHS of adalimumab , certolizumab pegol , etanercept , golimumab and infliximab , within their licensed indications , for the treatment of severe active AS or severe nr-AxSpA ( but with objective signs of inflammation ) .	The efficacy estimates were consistently slightly smaller for nr-AxSpA than for AS . In AS , anti-TNFs are approximately equally effective . Sequential treatment with anti-TNFs can be worthwhile but the drug survival response rates and benefits are reduced with second and third anti-TNFs . CONCLUSIONS In both AS and nr-AxSpA population s anti-TNFs are clinical ly effective , although more so in AS than in nr-AxSpA. Anti-TNFs may be an effective use of NHS re sources depending on which assumptions are considered appropriate .

Most commonly , milk ( expressed breast milk or formula ) is given by bottle . Whether using bottles during establishment of breast feeds is detrimental to breast feeding success is a topic of ongoing debate . OBJECTIVES To identify the effects of avoidance of bottle feeds during establishment of breast feeding on the likelihood of successful breast feeding , and to assess the safety of alternatives to bottle feeds .	This effect was evident at all time points for the tube alone strategy and for all except any breast feeding at three months post discharge for cup feeding . Investigators reported no clear benefit when the novel teat was used . No other benefits or harms were evident , including , in contrast to the previous ( 2008 ) review , length of hospital stay . AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS Evidence of low to moderate quality suggests that supplementing breast feeds by cup increases the extent and duration of breast feeding .	The is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of bottles during establishment of breast feeding in preterm infants.												
205186000	bart_predictions	BACKGROUND Current guidelines recommend that patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) should be treated with systemic corticosteroid for seven to 14 days . Intermittent systemic corticosteroid use is cumulatively associated with adverse effects such as osteoporosis , hyperglycaemia and muscle weakness . Shorter treatment could reduce adverse effects . OBJECTIVES To compare the efficacy of short- duration ( seven or fewer days ) and conventional longer- duration ( longer than seven days ) systemic corticosteroid treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD .	Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of oral corticosteroids is likely to be sufficient for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD , and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroids ( of around five days ) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer ( 10 to 14 days ) courses .	TheCLUSIONS Short- duration ( seven or fewer days ) systemic corticosteroid treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD is associated with an increased risk of adverse effects compared to conventional longer- duration treatment.												
39986551	longformer_predictions	BACKGROUND Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea ( OSAH ) causes excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) , impairs quality of life ( QoL ) and increases cardiovascular disease and road traffic accident risks . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment is clinical ly effective but undermined by intolerance , and its cost-effectiveness is borderline in milder cases . M and ibular advancement devices ( MADs ) are another option , but evidence is lacking regarding their clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in milder disease . OBJECTIVES ( 1 ) Conduct a r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ) examining the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MADs against no treatment in mild to moderate OSAH .	M and ibular advancement devices are clinical ly effective and cost-effective in mild to moderate OSAH .	TheORS'CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of CPAP in patients with OSAH.												
21845076	bart_predictions	IMPORTANCE Human serum bactericidal antibody levels ( hSBA ) are commonly used as an immune correlate of protection after vaccination against meningococcal disease . We performed a systematic review of how well this marker correlates with protection induced by outer membrane vesicle ( OMV ) vaccines against meningococcal B ( MenB ) disease . OBJECTIVE To compare vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) of OMV vaccines against MenB predicted by hSBA ( predicted protection ) to VE from clinical studies ( observed protection ) .	In general , predicted VE tended to be lower than observed VE . CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE : hSBA induced by OMV vaccines correlates moderately well with protection against MenB in older children and adults . The correlation was poor at very young ages , for which low VE was observed	TheORS'CONCLUSIONS HSBA predicted protection is a protective marker of OMV vaccines against MenB disease.

Successful interventions possessed higher adherence and lower attrition rates and were predominantly conducted among normal weight population s. No clear patterns or consistencies of exercise dose and reductions in weight gain were evident . CONCLUSIONS An exercise dose associated with reductions in weight gain was unquantifiable among these interventions . Adherence and retention rates were strong contributors to the success of exercise interventions on gestational weight gain .	The exercise dose was not significantly associated with weight gain during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS Exercise dose is not associated with weight gain during pregnancy

The subgroup analysis revealed a trend towards underestimation of the temperature for febrile patients . Conclusions TAT is not sufficiently accurate to replace one of the reference methods such as rectal , bladder or more invasive temperature measurement methods . The results are , however , similar to those with tympanic thermometers , both in our meta- analysis and when compared with others .	The systematic review and meta- analysis suggests that TAT is a reliable and accurate method for the detection of fever in children .												
2263867	longformer_predictions	BACKGROUND Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( bDMARDs ) extend the treatment choices for rheumatoid arthritis patients with suboptimal response or intolerance to conventional DMARDs . The objective of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to compare the relative efficacy of EU-licensed bDMARD combination therapy or monotherapy for patients intolerant of or contraindicated to continued methotrexate .	The etanercept combination was significantly better than the tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors adalimumab and infliximab in improving ACR 20/50/70 outcomes , with no significant differences between the etanercept combination and certolizumab pegol or tocilizumab . Licensed-dose etanercept , adalimumab , and tocilizumab monotherapy were significantly better than placebo in improving ACR 20/50/70 outcomes . CONCLUSION Licensed bDMARDs are efficacious in patients with an inadequate response to conventional therapy , but tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor combination therapies are not equally effective	TheORS'CONCLUSIONS EU-licensed bDMARD combination therapy or monotherapy for patients with suboptimal response or intolerance to conventional DMARDs appears to be superior to MTX in terms of efficacy and safety in the treatment of RA.

8594446	bart_predictions	BACKGROUND Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors ( anti-TNFs ) are typically used when the inflammatory rheumatologic diseases ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis ( nr-AxSpA ) have not responded adequately to conventional therapy . Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) guidance recommends treatment with adalimumab , etanercept and golimumab in adults with active ( severe ) AS only if certain criteria are fulfilled but it does not recommend infliximab for AS . Anti-TNFs for patients with nr-AxSpA have not previously been appraised by NICE . OBJECTIVE To determine the clinical effectiveness , safety and cost-effectiveness within the NHS of adalimumab , certolizumab pegol , etanercept , golimumab and infliximab , within their licensed indications , for the treatment of severe active AS or severe nr-AxSpA ( but with objective signs of inflammation ) .	The efficacy estimates were consistently slightly smaller for nr-AxSpA than for AS . In AS , anti-TNFs are approximately equally effective . Sequential treatment with anti-TNFs can be worthwhile but the drug survival response rates and benefits are reduced with second and third anti-TNFs . CONCLUSIONS In both AS and nr-AxSpA population s anti-TNFs are clinical ly effective , although more so in AS than in nr-AxSpA. Anti-TNFs may be an effective use of NHS re sources depending on which assumptions are considered appropriate .	TheCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to recommend infliximab for the treatment of patients with active active AS or severe nr-AxSpA. There is limited evidence to support the use of infliximab. There is no evidence to suggest that the use of adalimumab is associated with an increased risk of adverse events.	1: Somewhat--there are some grammatical or lexical errors but I can understand the meaning

205191092	longformer_predictions	BACKGROUND Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis . Although corticosteroids may improve symptoms , they have significant adverse effects . Steroids which act topically , with less systemic side-effects may be more desirable . Budesonide is a topically acting corticosteroid with extensive first pass hepatic metabolism . There are currently three formulations of budesonide : two st and ard formulations including a controlled-ileal release capsule and a pH-dependent capsule both design ed to release the drug in the distal small intestine and right colon ; and the newer Budesonide-MMX ® capsule design ed to release the drug throughout the entire colon . OBJECTIVES The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis .	Moderate quality evidence to supports the use of oral budesonide-MMX ® at a 9 mg daily dose for induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis , particularly in patients with left-sided colitis . Budesonide-MMX ® 9 mg daily is effective for induction of remission in the presence or absence of concurrent 5-ASA therapy . Further , budesonide-MMX ® appears to be safe , and does not lead to significant impairment of adrenocorticoid function compared to placebo . Moderate quality evidence from a single study suggests that mesalamine may be superior to st and ard budesonide for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis .

3272236	longformer_predictions	BACKGROUND Cytotoxic chemotherapy has a limited place in the management of advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer . Commonly used agents include cisplatin and doxorubicin , but the side-effect profile may be unacceptable for many patients . The feasibility of administration of combination chemotherapy is limited in many patients on account of significant co-morbidity . While early-stage endometrial adenocarcinoma is a common gynaecological cancer with a favourable prognosis , advanced or recurrent disease presents a difficult management problem . The platinum and anthracycline compounds have been widely used for many years , but their impact on progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) is not clear . This systematic review aim ed to evaluate both the benefits and adverse effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy in these women .	OS was improved when doxorubicin , cisplatin and other drugs were compared with doxorubicin and cisplatin . Toxicity was generally higher with more chemotherapy . Platinums , anthracyclines and taxanes were the most studied in phase II trials and combinations gave the best responses , but patient selection and pre-treatment was very variable . CONCLUSIONS More intense combination chemotherapy significantly improves the disease-free survival and the data indicate a modest improvement in OS . The addition of anthracyclines ( e.g. doxorubicin ) or the taxanes [ e.g. paclitaxel ( Taxol ) ] to cisplatin increases the response rate . More intensive regimens are associated with the gain in survival . However , grade 3 and 4 myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity are also increased .	The is the first systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination chemotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma.	1: Somewhat--there are some grammatical or lexical errors but I can understand the meaning

A small to moderate positive effect of physical activity during treatment was seen for physical activity level , aerobic fitness , muscular strength , functional quality of life , anxiety , and self-esteem . With few exceptions , exercise was well tolerated during and post treatment without adverse events . Conclusions Current evidence suggests many health benefits from physical activity during and post cancer treatments .	The systematic review and meta- analysis suggests that physical activity during and after treatment is appropriate and effective for cancer survivors.	2: Yes--there are no errors that impact comprehension of the summary											
25435871	bart_predictions	BACKGROUND Around 50 % of women of childbearing age are either overweight [ body mass index ( BMI ) 25 - 29.9 kg/m(2 ) ] or obese ( BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2 ) ) . The antenatal period provides an opportunity to manage weight in pregnancy . This has the potential to reduce maternal and fetal complications associated with excess weight gain and obesity . OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of dietary and lifestyle interventions in reducing or preventing obesity in pregnancy and to assess the beneficial and adverse effects of the interventions on obstetric , fetal and neonatal outcomes .	There were no significant maternal or fetal adverse effects observed for the interventions in the included trials . There was high- quality evidence for small-for-gestational-age infants as an outcome . There was significant heterogeneity for the beneficial effect of diet on gestational weight gain . CONCLUSIONS Interventions in pregnancy to manage weight result in a significant reduction in weight gain in pregnancy ( evidence quality was moderate ) . Dietary interventions are the most effective type of intervention in pregnancy in reducing gestational weight gain and the risks of pre-eclampsia , gestational hypertension and shoulder dystocia . There is no evidence of harm as a result of the dietary and physical activity-based interventions in pregnancy .	The is insufficient evidence to determine whether dietary and lifestyle interventions are effective in reducing or preventing weight gain in pregnant women.	1: Somewhat--there are some grammatical or lexical errors but I can understand the meaning

In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed. Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.', 'Oral ear drops containing NCT are as effective and safe as oral drops containing neomycin and dexamethasone for the treatment of AOE.', '2: Yes--there are no errors that impact comprehension of the summary', '2: Yes', '1: Partially', '0: No', '', 'Other / uncertain (please comment)', '(+1): Positive effect', 'target summary has multiple interventions w/ different outcome effect directions', 'Other / uncertain (please comment)', '2: Moderate claim', 'target summary has multiple interventions w/ different outcome strengtha', 'Erin', 'CD004740_01GCRZERDX9XKMDWQ5GDSPNXTA', 'SPNXTA'], ['01G4NE2DDS5G6Q047M97PX7SGV', 'CD004878', 'Current evidence does not support a clinically relevant effect of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids on admissions or length of hospitalisation.
